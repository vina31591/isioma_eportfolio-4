          <h1>Network & Information Management </h1>
          <h6>By demonstrating hands-on knowledge of one of the most important topics in information security today,
            network
            technology, this module will give you a solid understanding of security concepts and terminology. The goal
            of our class
            is to provide knowledge in the basics of both information security and network technology, as we assume no
            prior
            knowledge about these topics. In this lesson, vulnerabilities are assessed, penetration tests are performed,
            forensic
            analysis is performed, and breach management is defined.
            After a brief review of some of the challenges facing the Internet today, we will look at how recent and
            emerging network
            technology might help mitigate some of the problems.

                <br>
                <h4>MY INITIAL POST</h4>
                <p> The context of the study is on the empirical analysis of the viability demonstrates medical systems
                  are also considered IoT systems. The research according to the authors, is to investigate the
                  development of a methodology for assessing vulnerabilities. </p><br>
                This action is performed through penetration tests for training purposes by students at the University
                of
                South Alabama on the istan mannequin, which is a medical mannequin that simulates respiratory,
                neurological and cardiovascular systems (CAE Healthcare). </p><br>
                <p>The authors explained Cyber-physical threats intensively from the increasingly pervasive integration
                  of
                  technology into medical arenas. They were able to identify software vulnerabilities and have reported
                  a
                  growing number of exploitable vulnerabilities, and possible intentional failure on these istan medical
                  mannequin security breaches are inevitable because of the long-term consequences as a result of the
                  increasing dependence on technology. </p><br>
                <p> They also outline fundamental security concerns like medical identity theft denial of service TCP
                  network protocol vulnerable to DOS attacks. The 802.11 wireless transmissions communicate between the
                  mannequin and the control machines, which is vulnerable to brute force attacks (Glisson et al., 2015).
                  This attack allows the ability to control or reprogram these medical mannequins wirelessly. This
                  attack
                  also performs threats to elevate user privileges by performing a brute force attack (obtaining valid
                  user and password) and security control attacks that deny service to the software application by
                  simulating false entry signals and potentially causing physical damage. (Glisson et al. 2015) By
                  incorrectly analysing life-threatening critical data by medical personnel, the breach of medical
                  training environments may impact thousands of lives in the medical profession over the long term. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Among the first techniques to mitigate DDoS attacks is to minimise the area that can be targeted,
                  thereby reducing the options for attackers and enabling the implementation of protections Information
                  technology infrastructures.</p></b><br>
                <p>The best defence against password attacks is ensuring that passwords are as strong as they can be.
                  Multi-Factor Authentication Techniques and Honeypot systems are beneficial for detecting attackers.
                  This
                  requires establishing the proper authentication, privacy and confidentiality mechanisms. (Pankaj,
                  2005)
                  Finally, it is vital to secure the different wireless communication protocols that the istan mannequin
                  relies on to maintain a high level of security..</p></b><br>

                <h6> <b> Peer Response by Osarodion Samuel Tolofari</b></h6>

                <p>As rightly pointed out Isioma, medical systems are also considered IoT systems. IoT, while
                  influential
                  and beneficial, introduces several security issues. IoT's key risks include network
                  vulnerabilities and outdated software and firmware (Shea, 2021). they often are produced with Weak or
                  hardcoded passwords. By default, attackers may already know the device's password. Usually,
                  passwords are easy to guess, are publicly available or cannot be changed, and are vulnerable to
                  credential theft. One notable example of such an attack is Mirai malware. The Lack of an update
                  process
                  or mechanism.

                  Like many IoT devices, the medical mannequin IoT products are designed with ease of use and
                  connectivity. Unfortunately, when hackers discover new security vulnerabilities or bugs, they become
                  vulnerable even if they are secure at purchase. Over time, IoT devices become exposed if regular
                  updates
                  are not applied (Thales, 2021). </p><br>
                <p>In addition to the mitigative measures, you have already stated in this discussion. To mitigate the
                  risks associated with this device,
                  manufacturers of the mannequin should consider policies such as password complexity, password
                  expiration, account lockout, and one-time passwords that require users to modify credentials when
                  setting up the device.

                  Network managers can use adapted Identity and Access Management solutions to reduce the likelihood of
                  IoT attacks. Only signed updates and encrypted exchanges should be included for authenticity when
                  applying updates (D Jude Hemanth, J Anitha and Tsihrintzis, 2021).</p><br>

                <h6> <b>Post by Beran Necat</b></h6>
                <p>Hi Isioma and Osarodion,

                  Thank you for your analysis.

                  Just to add to this interesting concept.

                  A recent Deloitte (2018) report projects that nearly 70% of medical devices will be connected to
                  networks by 2025. The explosion of connected medical devices now has its own internet of things (IoT)
                  subcategory: IoMT,
                  the internet of medical things. (Folsom, 2021) As regulatory pressure continues to grow, and with
                  exponential growth in cyber threats, effective management of cybersecurity strategies will require
                  integrated expertise from Clinical Engineering, IT, Quality, Regulatory and Security. (McAleer, S &
                  Reich, D., 2016).

                  Any thoughts on this?</p>

                <h6> <b> Peer Response by Hamad Ahmad</b></h6>
                <p> Hi Isioma, I certainly see your point about the effects of technology on medical arenas. I agree
                  that
                  medical systems are IoT systems. In fact, in E-healthcare,
                  internet-connected devices are used to build the structure of Medical systems. Smart devices open up
                  more
                  entry points for cyber-physical threats. I would also like to add medical software vulnerabilities
                  ranging
                  from malware that compromises the confidentiality of patients and integrity of medical systems to DDOS
                  attacks that interrupt the capability of medical facilities to offer care services (Nair, Tyagi and
                  Goyal,
                  2019). Besides, I strongly agree that failure to mitigate security breaches of istan mannequin medical
                  software has long-term consequences. I agree that medical identity theft permits attackers to control
                  and
                  reprogram medical software wirelessly. In addition, it allows attackers to acquire legal user
                  passwords
                  to
                  steal insurance information and file fraudulent reports on individuals' insurance (Frankenfield,
                  2021).
                  I
                  want to add this question; what are the effective ways of preventing medical identity theft? </p><br>
                <p> I strongly agree that it is crucial to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. I
                  certainly see your point of using the technique of implementing Protection Information Technology
                  Infrastructures and minimizing areas that
                  attackers can target to reduce DDOS attacks. I would also like to add that DDOS attacks slow down
                  networks and machines, making medical systems and resources inaccessible to users (Overby, 2021).
                  Other ways of preventing DDOS attacks include; observing and scrutinizing network traffic, fortifying
                  software safety posture, and establishing a DDOS attack response plan. I agree that Honeypot systems
                  and
                  Multi-Factor Authentication Techniques are
                  valuable for spotting software intruders. I want to add this question; what security mechanism can be
                  used to establish confidentiality, integrity, and authentication? I agree that the istan mannequin
                  must
                  secure its system with diverse
                  wireless communication protocols to uphold a high-security level.

                <p>The Internet is intended to be an open system, so corporate systems on the Internet are especially
                  vulnerable since external
                  threats are more likely to affect them due to the Internet being an open system. Denial of service
                  (DoS)
                  attacks can be
                  unleashed or corporate networks can be penetrated to cause serious disruptions.The aim of this unit is
                  to
                  consider, evaluate,
                  and classify toolkits</p>
                <p>The foundations for future discussions about mitigation techniques will be laid with
                  industry-standard
                  examples of security flaws and threats based on a case study.</p>

                <p>DREAD Analysis</p>
                <p> Using the STRIDE threat model we have identified 2 main threats to the iStan devices</p>

                <p>1.Threat of denial of service on the iStan devices.</p>

                <p>As proven by the case study and discussion posts it is possible to cause a denial of service attack
                  on
                  the
                  network making the iStan devices and software unavailable.</p>

                <p>2. Threat of tampering with the devices following a brute force attack.</p>

                <p>
                  Due to the ability to brute force attack the PIN on the network router this could allow a malicious
                  actor
                  to
                  tamper with the iStan devices and any connected information.

                <p>GROUP 2 meeting held on the 03/04/2022 at 1800hrs
                  The discussion started with all the members in attendance;</p>
                <p>Samuel</p>
                <p>Beth</p>
                <p>Jurbe </p>
                <p>Isioma</p>

                <p>Items discussed:</p>

                <p>1. We reviewed an NMAP scan of our website and discussed the vulnerabilities of open ports to be
                  added
                  to
                  the assignment.</p>

                <p>2. All group members agreed we have been working well as a group and have so far made good progress
                  on
                  the
                  assignment.</p>

                <p>3. Beth is going to format the assignment as a report to include contents and headings, and add a
                  DREAD
                  analysis to the table - the group will then discuss the risk ratings and agree the order of
                  vulnerabilities
                  by risk.</p>

                <p>4. Isioma suggested a summary will be needed to conclude the report - all agreed.</p>

                <p>5. Once we have completed the report and we are happy we have met the requirements of the assignment
                  we
                  will
                  review any contents that may need to be removed to meet the word count.</p>

                <p>6. The focus this week will be finishing the report and then next weeks meeting we will complete any
                  seminar
                  preparation.</p>


                <p>We will meet again next week Sunday by 1800hrs to discuss the progress on the above.</p>

                <h4><b> Summary post on the collabarative learning discussion 1; a continuation of unit 1 </b></h4>

                <h6><b>MY SUMMARY POST </b></h6>
                <p>Glaisson et al. (2015) review the results of two malicious attacks performed by students at the
                  University of South Alabama. A penetration testing project that exploited a TCP network protocol
                  vulnerability at the mannequin's internal access point and the other uses 802.11 wireless
                  broadcasting to carry out brute force attacks.

                  Tolofari, S (2022) shared more light on how many IoT devices the medical mannequin IoT products are
                  designed for easy use and connectivity.
                  Despite being secure at the point of purchase, hackers frequently discover new security flaws or
                  bugs.
                  In the absence of regular updates, IoT devices become vulnerable over time. It is correct to state
                  that the
                  explosion of connected medical devices now has its subcategory of the internet of things (IoT):
                  IoMT, the
                  internet of medical things, as regulations continue to tighten. Cybersecurity concerns are
                  omnipresent
                  in connected medical devices, as connected devices present additional risks for data security as the
                  number of devices increases.</p>

                <p>Necat, B & Ahamd, H (2022) shared more light on how in the era of increasing
                  regulatory pressure and exponential cyber threat growth, managing cybersecurity
                  strategies will require the skills of Clinical Engineering, IT, Quality, Regulatory,
                  and Security.

                  (Ahamd2022) brought insightful thoughts about Techniques like Multi-Factor Authentication
                  identifying software intruders and how confidentiality, integrity, and authentication is
                  achieved by using a security mechanism To maintain a high level of security.

                  Nevertheless, As a result, there is a critical need for large-scale enhanced
                  data security, appropriate use of Inventory control, monitoring, encrypting
                  data, training and maintenance process of all internet of medical things.</p>

                  Summary Post

                  In my initial post, I highlighted the exercise that required us to perform a scanning exercise on
                  our
                  assigned website; my group opted to conduct the task individually and later compare the results. It
                  was
                  a straightforward exercise as the routing result, which I elaborated on in the initial post, was
                  gotten
                  from using the command tracert in the command prompt. Unfortunately, this also produced the hop with
                  the highest latency.</p>

                <p>Using open-source tools to find out the MX lookup gave me other details like the Ip address, the
                  registrar information, and the hosting ISP.

                  During the discussions, Beran asked if I encountered any difficulties during the exercise. There
                  weren’t any issues as all the expected results were obtained except for the registrar’s personal
                  information, usually withheld still; as the discussion went on, Jonathan pointed out that, according
                  to Crawford (2019), using a VPN service does impact ping as it has routed through a server and
                  coupled
                  with encryption and decryption processes and other users, which can cause latency.</p>

                <p>Agne also quoted Dobin (2020) that the use of a firewall is cited as one of the reasons why latency
                  is
                  high, as a firewall has to check data packages sent and received by a computer, coupled with
                  location,
                  the internet provider is factors that influence the latency of the packet.</p>

                <p>Traceroute results can be affected by a variety of factors, including the distance to the server,
                  connection speed, the speed of the network, the number of devices sharing the connection; this was
                  the
                  case with one of my group members, Jubert, whose result showed the highest latency of 413ms in hop
                  two
                  due to satellite internet connections that are routed through base stations which are designated
                  service stations located at strategic points either interconnected via fibre optic cables or
                  wireless
                  depending on their desired coverage in his location (Jubet, 2022).</p>

                <p> 1.0 Introduction
                  Any organisation using a website must take appropriate steps to ensure its security (Thia & Hieu,
                  2019).
                  This is vital to prevent an attack that could compromise the website and to ensure compliance with
                  governing
                  bodies and regulations. Following a review of https://allmytype.co.uk, this report identifies the
                  applicable regulations,
                  intended audience, and information held on the site and then assesses the potential
                  vulnerabilities,
                  risks and how these can be mitigated.</p>

                2.0 Governing Bodies and Regulation
                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); All UK organisations must abide by GDPR when processing
                personal information (ICO, 2018).
                Personal data must be secured by appropriate technical measures to ensure the confidentiality,
                integrity and availability of the systems.
                Consent must be given for the use of personal data, and the right to be forgotten must be met.
                The information must be used in a manner that is fair, lawful and transparent, for specified,
                explicit purposes, be limited to what is necessary and kept for no longer than needed. (Gov.UK,
                2018).
                Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy; protects against cybersquatting (ICANN.org, 2016)
                The Intellectual Property Office guides UK Copyright law; Owners found by the courts to be
                infringing copyright can be fined and or imprisoned (Intellectual Property Office, 2011).</p>


                3.0 Intended audience and functionality
                The website is publicly available to anyone who has the URL. The website administrator can log into
                the site, and users can enter names and comments. Visitors may submit their email addresses to
                subscribe to posts; their email may be held, which is classed as personal information (ICO, 2018).

                Emails must only be sent to those who opt-in to receive them (including newsletters, sales or not).
                To maintain compliance with GDPR, users must have the ability to unsubscribe from blog emails after
                signing up.
                Most email software will do this automatically, but you must not remove the 'unsubscribe' link by
                accident. Subscribers should be able to easily unsubscribe themselves from your email list by
                following simple steps.</p>

                <p> 4.0 Vulnerabilities in Web Design
                  GDPR requires data protection by design; in order to meet this requirement, the website must be
                  built with security features and take into consideration vulnerabilities that could impact the
                  personal data stored on the site. Threat modelling should be completed for critical
                  authentication, access control, business logic, and key flows and plausibility checks integrated
                  at each tier of the application. The OWASP (2021) top 10 vulnerabilities can be used to advise on
                  the highest security risks to web applications and should be a focus when designing any site that
                  holds personal information. Applying mitigating actions against each vulnerability can protect an
                  organisation from GDPR breaches (Vagenas & Iakovakis, 2019).

                <p>4.1 Potential Vulnerabilities </p>
                <p>SQL Injection</p>
                <p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</p>
                <p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</p>
                Security Misconfiguration</p>
                Insufficient Logging & Monitoring</p>
                Cryptographic Failures</p>
                Broken Access Control</p>
                Vulnerable and Outdated Components</p>
                Software and Data Integrity Failures</p>
                Improper error handling </p>
                Open ports</p>
                Weak log in credentials </p>

                5.0 Vulnerability Risk Assessment & Recommendations
                Following the identification of potential vulnerabilities to the site, they have been assessed using
                a DREAD analysis (Mackman et al, 2003). A rating of 1-10 was used for each category and then scored
                according to low, medium and high risk to the website. Business priority should be addressing the
                high risks first.
                </p>
