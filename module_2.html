          <h1>Network & Information Management </h1>
          <h6>By demonstrating hands-on knowledge of one of the most important topics in information security today,
            network
            technology, this module will give you a solid understanding of security concepts and terminology. The goal
            of our class
            is to provide knowledge in the basics of both information security and network technology, as we assume no
            prior
            knowledge about these topics. In this lesson, vulnerabilities are assessed, penetration tests are performed,
            forensic
            analysis is performed, and breach management is defined.
            After a brief review of some of the challenges facing the Internet today, we will look at how recent and
            emerging network
            technology might help mitigate some of the problems.

                <li>Answer the following discussion questions:</li>

                <li>What are the major threats and vulnerabilities discussed in the paper?</li>

                <br>
                <h4>MY INITIAL POST</h4>
                <p> The context of the study is on the empirical analysis of the viability demonstrates medical systems
                  are also considered IoT systems. The research according to the authors, is to investigate the
                  development of a methodology for assessing vulnerabilities. </p><br>
                This action is performed through penetration tests for training purposes by students at the University
                of
                South Alabama on the istan mannequin, which is a medical mannequin that simulates respiratory,
                neurological and cardiovascular systems (CAE Healthcare). </p><br>
                <p>The authors explained Cyber-physical threats intensively from the increasingly pervasive integration
                  of
                  technology into medical arenas. They were able to identify software vulnerabilities and have reported
                  a
                  growing number of exploitable vulnerabilities, and possible intentional failure on these istan medical
                  mannequin security breaches are inevitable because of the long-term consequences as a result of the
                  increasing dependence on technology. </p><br>
                <p> They also outline fundamental security concerns like medical identity theft denial of service TCP
                  network protocol vulnerable to DOS attacks. The 802.11 wireless transmissions communicate between the
                  mannequin and the control machines, which is vulnerable to brute force attacks (Glisson et al., 2015).
                  This attack allows the ability to control or reprogram these medical mannequins wirelessly. This
                  attack
                  also performs threats to elevate user privileges by performing a brute force attack (obtaining valid
                  user and password) and security control attacks that deny service to the software application by
                  simulating false entry signals and potentially causing physical damage. (Glisson et al. 2015) By
                  incorrectly analysing life-threatening critical data by medical personnel, the breach of medical
                  training environments may impact thousands of lives in the medical profession over the long term. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Among the first techniques to mitigate DDoS attacks is to minimise the area that can be targeted,
                  thereby reducing the options for attackers and enabling the implementation of protections Information
                  technology infrastructures.</p></b><br>
                <p>The best defence against password attacks is ensuring that passwords are as strong as they can be.
                  Multi-Factor Authentication Techniques and Honeypot systems are beneficial for detecting attackers.
                  This
                  requires establishing the proper authentication, privacy and confidentiality mechanisms. (Pankaj,
                  2005)
                  Finally, it is vital to secure the different wireless communication protocols that the istan mannequin
                  relies on to maintain a high level of security..</p></b><br>

                <h6> <b> Peer Response by Osarodion Samuel Tolofari</b></h6>

                <p>As rightly pointed out Isioma, medical systems are also considered IoT systems. IoT, while
                  influential
                  and beneficial, introduces several security issues. IoT's key risks include network
                  vulnerabilities and outdated software and firmware (Shea, 2021). they often are produced with Weak or
                  hardcoded passwords. By default, attackers may already know the device's password. Usually,
                  passwords are easy to guess, are publicly available or cannot be changed, and are vulnerable to
                  credential theft. One notable example of such an attack is Mirai malware. The Lack of an update
                  process
                  or mechanism.

                  Like many IoT devices, the medical mannequin IoT products are designed with ease of use and
                  connectivity. Unfortunately, when hackers discover new security vulnerabilities or bugs, they become
                  vulnerable even if they are secure at purchase. Over time, IoT devices become exposed if regular
                  updates
                  are not applied (Thales, 2021). </p><br>
                <p>In addition to the mitigative measures, you have already stated in this discussion. To mitigate the
                  risks associated with this device,
                  manufacturers of the mannequin should consider policies such as password complexity, password
                  expiration, account lockout, and one-time passwords that require users to modify credentials when
                  setting up the device.

                  Network managers can use adapted Identity and Access Management solutions to reduce the likelihood of
                  IoT attacks. Only signed updates and encrypted exchanges should be included for authenticity when
                  applying updates (D Jude Hemanth, J Anitha and Tsihrintzis, 2021).</p><br>

                <h6> <b>Post by Beran Necat</b></h6>
                <p>Hi Isioma and Osarodion,

                  Thank you for your analysis.

                  Just to add to this interesting concept.

                  A recent Deloitte (2018) report projects that nearly 70% of medical devices will be connected to
                  networks by 2025. The explosion of connected medical devices now has its own internet of things (IoT)
                  subcategory: IoMT,
                  the internet of medical things. (Folsom, 2021) As regulatory pressure continues to grow, and with
                  exponential growth in cyber threats, effective management of cybersecurity strategies will require
                  integrated expertise from Clinical Engineering, IT, Quality, Regulatory and Security. (McAleer, S &
                  Reich, D., 2016).

                  Any thoughts on this?</p>

                <h6> <b> Peer Response by Hamad Ahmad</b></h6>
                <p> Hi Isioma, I certainly see your point about the effects of technology on medical arenas. I agree
                  that
                  medical systems are IoT systems. In fact, in E-healthcare,
                  internet-connected devices are used to build the structure of Medical systems. Smart devices open up
                  more
                  entry points for cyber-physical threats. I would also like to add medical software vulnerabilities
                  ranging
                  from malware that compromises the confidentiality of patients and integrity of medical systems to DDOS
                  attacks that interrupt the capability of medical facilities to offer care services (Nair, Tyagi and
                  Goyal,
                  2019). Besides, I strongly agree that failure to mitigate security breaches of istan mannequin medical
                  software has long-term consequences. I agree that medical identity theft permits attackers to control
                  and
                  reprogram medical software wirelessly. In addition, it allows attackers to acquire legal user
                  passwords
                  to
                  steal insurance information and file fraudulent reports on individuals' insurance (Frankenfield,
                  2021).
                  I
                  want to add this question; what are the effective ways of preventing medical identity theft? </p><br>
                <p> I strongly agree that it is crucial to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. I
                  certainly see your point of using the technique of implementing Protection Information Technology
                  Infrastructures and minimizing areas that
                  attackers can target to reduce DDOS attacks. I would also like to add that DDOS attacks slow down
                  networks and machines, making medical systems and resources inaccessible to users (Overby, 2021).
                  Other ways of preventing DDOS attacks include; observing and scrutinizing network traffic, fortifying
                  software safety posture, and establishing a DDOS attack response plan. I agree that Honeypot systems
                  and
                  Multi-Factor Authentication Techniques are
                  valuable for spotting software intruders. I want to add this question; what security mechanism can be
                  used to establish confidentiality, integrity, and authentication? I agree that the istan mannequin
                  must
                  secure its system with diverse
                  wireless communication protocols to uphold a high-security level.

        <p> During unit 1, we were asked to start a discussion on the threats and vulnerabilities applicable to a medical mannequin. This unit 
          task has allowed the improvement of my research and information skills. Understand the fundamental concepts of Confidentiality, 
          Integrity and Availability (CIA) in Cyber Security. Appreciate the competencies required to address Cyber Security issues in the 
          Information Security management system. Gain awareness of the ethical and governance frameworks around information systems security and 
          data protection acts. I have developed an understanding of the implications of the Information Security management system. Evaluated 
          available techniques and technologies at database and metadata levels dealing with privacy and data disclosure. Critically evaluate the 
          implications of vulnerabilities and threats in software and network.</p>

                <p>The Internet is intended to be an open system, so corporate systems on the Internet are especially
                  vulnerable since external
                  threats are more likely to affect them due to the Internet being an open system. Denial of service
                  (DoS)
                  attacks can be
                  unleashed or corporate networks can be penetrated to cause serious disruptions.The aim of this unit is
                  to
                  consider, evaluate,
                  and classify toolkits</p>
                <p>The foundations for future discussions about mitigation techniques will be laid with
                  industry-standard
                  examples of security flaws and threats based on a case study.</p>

                <p>DREAD Analysis</p>
                <p> Using the STRIDE threat model we have identified 2 main threats to the iStan devices</p>

                <p>1.Threat of denial of service on the iStan devices.</p>

                <p>As proven by the case study and discussion posts it is possible to cause a denial of service attack
                  on
                  the
                  network making the iStan devices and software unavailable.</p>

                <p>2. Threat of tampering with the devices following a brute force attack.</p>

                <p>
                  Due to the ability to brute force attack the PIN on the network router this could allow a malicious
                  actor
                  to
                  tamper with the iStan devices and any connected information.

                <p>Jurbe </p>
                <p>Isioma</p>

                <p>Items discussed:</p>

                <p>1. We reviewed an NMAP scan of our website and discussed the vulnerabilities of open ports to be
                  added
                  to
                  the assignment.</p>

                <p>2. All group members agreed we have been working well as a group and have so far made good progress
                  on
                  the
                  assignment.</p>

                <p>3. Beth is going to format the assignment as a report to include contents and headings, and add a
                  DREAD
                  analysis to the table - the group will then discuss the risk ratings and agree the order of
                  vulnerabilities
                  by risk.</p>

                <p>4. Isioma suggested a summary will be needed to conclude the report - all agreed.</p>

                <p>5. Once we have completed the report and we are happy we have met the requirements of the assignment
                  we
                  will
                  review any contents that may need to be removed to meet the word count.</p>

                <p>6. The focus this week will be finishing the report and then next weeks meeting we will complete any
                  seminar
                  preparation.</p>


                <p>We will meet again next week Sunday by 1800hrs to discuss the progress on the above.</p>

            <p> Current approaches to cyber-security are not working, rather than producing more security, we seem to be facing less. The focus 
              on the Unit crowds out consideration for the security of the individual citizen, with detrimental effects on the whole system. A 
              solution would have to be informed by an ethics of the information technology that is based on the dignity of information related 
              to security. i was asigned to Group 2 and we were asked to  Use the (DREAD Analysis) STRIDE threat model we have identified 2 main threats to the iStan devices</p>

                <p>Glaisson et al. (2015) review the results of two malicious attacks performed by students at the
                  University of South Alabama. A penetration testing project that exploited a TCP network protocol
                  vulnerability at the mannequin's internal access point and the other uses 802.11 wireless
                  broadcasting to carry out brute force attacks.

                  Tolofari, S (2022) shared more light on how many IoT devices the medical mannequin IoT products are
                  designed for easy use and connectivity.
                  Despite being secure at the point of purchase, hackers frequently discover new security flaws or
                  bugs.
                  In the absence of regular updates, IoT devices become vulnerable over time. It is correct to state
                  that the
                  explosion of connected medical devices now has its subcategory of the internet of things (IoT):
                  IoMT, the
                  internet of medical things, as regulations continue to tighten. Cybersecurity concerns are
                  omnipresent
                  in connected medical devices, as connected devices present additional risks for data security as the
                  number of devices increases.</p>

                <p>Necat, B & Ahamd, H (2022) shared more light on how in the era of increasing
                  regulatory pressure and exponential cyber threat growth, managing cybersecurity
                  strategies will require the skills of Clinical Engineering, IT, Quality, Regulatory,
                  and Security.

                  (Ahamd2022) brought insightful thoughts about Techniques like Multi-Factor Authentication
                  identifying software intruders and how confidentiality, integrity, and authentication is
                  achieved by using a security mechanism To maintain a high level of security.

                  Nevertheless, As a result, there is a critical need for large-scale enhanced
                  data security, appropriate use of Inventory control, monitoring, encrypting
                  data, training and maintenance process of all internet of medical things.</p>

                  Summary Post

                  In my initial post, I highlighted the exercise that required us to perform a scanning exercise on
                  our
                  assigned website; my group opted to conduct the task individually and later compare the results. It
                  was
                  a straightforward exercise as the routing result, which I elaborated on in the initial post, was
                  gotten
                  from using the command tracert in the command prompt. Unfortunately, this also produced the hop with
                  the highest latency.</p>

                <p>Using open-source tools to find out the MX lookup gave me other details like the Ip address, the
                  registrar information, and the hosting ISP.

                  During the discussions, Beran asked if I encountered any difficulties during the exercise. There
                  weren’t any issues as all the expected results were obtained except for the registrar’s personal
                  information, usually withheld still; as the discussion went on, Jonathan pointed out that, according
                  to Crawford (2019), using a VPN service does impact ping as it has routed through a server and
                  coupled
                  with encryption and decryption processes and other users, which can cause latency.</p>

                <p>Agne also quoted Dobin (2020) that the use of a firewall is cited as one of the reasons why latency
                  is
                  high, as a firewall has to check data packages sent and received by a computer, coupled with
                  location,
                  the internet provider is factors that influence the latency of the packet.</p>

                <p>Traceroute results can be affected by a variety of factors, including the distance to the server,
                  connection speed, the speed of the network, the number of devices sharing the connection; this was
                  the
                  case with one of my group members, Jubert, whose result showed the highest latency of 413ms in hop
                  two
                  due to satellite internet connections that are routed through base stations which are designated
                  service stations located at strategic points either interconnected via fibre optic cables or
                  wireless
                  depending on their desired coverage in his location (Jubet, 2022).</p>

                <p> 1.0 Introduction
                  Any organisation using a website must take appropriate steps to ensure its security (Thia & Hieu,
                  2019).
                  This is vital to prevent an attack that could compromise the website and to ensure compliance with
                  governing
                  bodies and regulations. Following a review of https://allmytype.co.uk, this report identifies the
                  applicable regulations,
                  intended audience, and information held on the site and then assesses the potential
                  vulnerabilities,
                  risks and how these can be mitigated.</p>

                2.0 Governing Bodies and Regulation
                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); All UK organisations must abide by GDPR when processing
                personal information (ICO, 2018).
                Personal data must be secured by appropriate technical measures to ensure the confidentiality,
                integrity and availability of the systems.
                Consent must be given for the use of personal data, and the right to be forgotten must be met.
                The information must be used in a manner that is fair, lawful and transparent, for specified,
                explicit purposes, be limited to what is necessary and kept for no longer than needed. (Gov.UK,
                2018).
                Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy; protects against cybersquatting (ICANN.org, 2016)
                The Intellectual Property Office guides UK Copyright law; Owners found by the courts to be
                infringing copyright can be fined and or imprisoned (Intellectual Property Office, 2011).</p>


                3.0 Intended audience and functionality
                The website is publicly available to anyone who has the URL. The website administrator can log into
                the site, and users can enter names and comments. Visitors may submit their email addresses to
                subscribe to posts; their email may be held, which is classed as personal information (ICO, 2018).

                Emails must only be sent to those who opt-in to receive them (including newsletters, sales or not).
                To maintain compliance with GDPR, users must have the ability to unsubscribe from blog emails after
                signing up.
                Most email software will do this automatically, but you must not remove the 'unsubscribe' link by
                accident. Subscribers should be able to easily unsubscribe themselves from your email list by
                following simple steps.</p>

                <p> 4.0 Vulnerabilities in Web Design
                  GDPR requires data protection by design; in order to meet this requirement, the website must be
                  built with security features and take into consideration vulnerabilities that could impact the
                  personal data stored on the site. Threat modelling should be completed for critical
                  authentication, access control, business logic, and key flows and plausibility checks integrated
                  at each tier of the application. The OWASP (2021) top 10 vulnerabilities can be used to advise on
                  the highest security risks to web applications and should be a focus when designing any site that
                  holds personal information. Applying mitigating actions against each vulnerability can protect an
                  organisation from GDPR breaches (Vagenas & Iakovakis, 2019).

                <p>4.1 Potential Vulnerabilities </p>
                <p>SQL Injection</p>
                <p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</p>
                <p>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</p>
                Security Misconfiguration</p>
                Insufficient Logging & Monitoring</p>
                Cryptographic Failures</p>
                Broken Access Control</p>
                Vulnerable and Outdated Components</p>
                Software and Data Integrity Failures</p>
                Improper error handling </p>
                Open ports</p>
                Weak log in credentials </p>

                5.0 Vulnerability Risk Assessment & Recommendations
                Following the identification of potential vulnerabilities to the site, they have been assessed using
                a DREAD analysis (Mackman et al, 2003). A rating of 1-10 was used for each category and then scored
                according to low, medium and high risk to the website. Business priority should be addressing the
                high risks first.

              <p>The Common Criteria on how to Evaluate and Apply Applicable Security Standards are usually international  policies and standard. Cyber security threats were widely recognised and valued, but different organisations dealt with them in varied ways depending on their size and industry. This has an 
                impact on the weight given to standardisation and certification as a strategy.</p>
                <p> To acquire complete visibility into your IT environment, every user, machine, host, and service must have a unique identity that can be monitored 
                  and managed centrally. The identity network should have adequate granularity to comprehend how multiple companies are related, including 
                  people, machines, data flow, and so on. It's hard to fully comprehend the security posture of any system if you can't see the extent of your 
                  infrastructure.</p>

                <p> Review on Case Study (8)   Failure to respond fully to an access request.

 

                  In accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UKGDPR) Act 1998 and 2003, employees have the right to request copies of the employer's data about them.
                  
                  This case study of Failure to respond fully to an access request establishes that the complainant has made a subject access request for CCTV footage from the educational organisation's premises for four hours. During this time, the complainant was assaulted by another employee. The educational organisation accepted it as a valid request but failed or intentionally withheld the access request, as delaying tactics were employed to avoid eventually having to release the CCTV footage because it was lost or was no longer retained.
                  
                  One of the fundamental rights in data protection regulations worldwide is the right of access, often known as the right to access or subject access. It is essential to understand this when reviewing the broader task of the GDPR Act of 1998 and 2003.
                  
                  However, failing to provide the complainant with all of their data within the statutory 40-day period, the educational organisation contravened Section 4 of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. And Data Protection Act 1998 and 2003, 21 subsection (2) Any person who fails to comply with the duty imposed by notification regulations made under section 20(1) is guilty of an offence. Instead of unilaterally deciding what CCTV footage to keep, the educational institution should have sought clarification from the complainant as to the CCTV footage the complainant was seeking.
                  
                  According to Article 5 of the GDPR, the new regulations that govern the processing of personal data provide six core principles. Personal data must be:
                  
                  1.       handled fairly, lawfully, and transparently;
                  
                  2.       Gathered for an explicit, legitimate, and specified purpose.
                  
                  3.       It must be sufficient, relevant, and limited only to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed;
                  
                  4.       it must be accurate and up-to-date where necessary;
                  
                  5.       For no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; and maintained in a format which permits identification of data subjects (people from whom personal data are collected, processed, and stored);</p>

            <p> In this review, Isioma points out that the educational organisation violated Section 4 of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 by failing to provide the complainant with the data within the statutory 40-day period.

              In the above case, the data subject’s right of access was severely delayed as there is no justification for such a lengthy delay in any circumstances. Such a delay is 
              particularly unacceptable in a situation where the requester sought a copy of personal data contained in the CCTV footage. The data controller
               is aware of the Data Protection Acts and regularly receives and processes subject access requests.</p>
               <p> Among the many complaints that arise in connection with the access requests is the data controller’s lateness in processing the request.
                  According to the Data Protection Acts, an access request must be responded to within 40 days, and if this deadline is not met, as in the case
                   described above, the data controller violates the Acts. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is very concerned about the 
                   prevalence of this infringement. In some instances, the data controller fails to acknowledge receiving the access request within 40 days. 
                   This means that the requester has no idea whether their access request is being dealt with or ignored. A common theme emerges in many of 
                   these complaints’ lateness on the data controller’s part in processing the access request. The Acts lay down 40 days for compliance with an 
                   access request, and if this is not met, as in the case outlined above, the data controller contravenes the Data Protection Acts.</p>

                    <p> Thanks for your interesting writeup about the failure to respond to access request.

                      As you said the data subject made a  subject access request to the data controller for a 4 hours data but the request was not fully responded to so the complainant only got 
                      11 seconds clip. This subject access request was supported under the Art 15 GDPR which states that the data subject can obtain access to the 
                      personal data about himself/herself.((General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), N.D)). Due to the way the educational institute processed 
                      this request, this earned the data subject the right to complain to the Data Protection Commission (DPC) and which the data subject did. 
                      The DPC is Ireland’s independent authority with responsibility for upholding the right of people in the EU to have their personal data 
                      protected. It monitors compliance with GDPR and other data protection legislation and deals with complaints in relation to data protection
                       breaches.(Citizens Information, N.D). The complainant may complain to the DPC if </p>
                      
                       <li>the complaint was refused access to the cctv images </li>

                        <li> If the complainant was not satisfied with the response to the request.</li>

              <p> I elaborated on the case study failure to respond fully to an access request in my initial post.

                The right of access is one of the fundamental rights in data protection regulations worldwide. The GDPR Act of 1998 and 2003 provides the right to access or subject access to 
                personal data. According to Article 5 of the GDPR, the new regulations that govern the processing of personal data provide some core principles. Personal data must be handled 
                fairly, lawfully, and transparently.
                
                Employees can request copies of their employer's data about them. In this case, an employee had made a subject access request for CCTV footage after being assaulted by another 
                employee.
                
                Ali Ahmad and Samuel Tolofari further expatiated that justice delayed is justice denied. Not providing valid evidence on time is also a crime, and that data must be sufficient,
                 relevant, and limited only for the purposes for which it is processed. It must be accurate and up to date when necessary; </p>
                 <p> The Data Protection Acts lay down 40 days for compliance with an access request, and if this is not met, the data controller contravenes the Acts. Unfortunately, in some
                    instances, the data controller fails to acknowledge receiving the access request within 40 days. Such a delay is particularly unacceptable in a situation where the requester 
                    sought a copy of personal data contained in CCTV footage. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is very concerned about the prevalence of this infringement. Instead of 
                    determining unilaterally what CCTV footage the complainant wanted, the organization should have preserved the footage for that date and sought to clarify what footage they were 
                    seeking from the complainant.</p>

                  <h6><b>1.0 Introduction </b></h6>
                  
                  <p> Website security is vital to any website, and organisations must ensure they implement appropriate levels of security when designing them. All websites that will process 
                    or store European or UK personal information must be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ensure appropriate organisational and technical measures are
                   put in place to ensure the security of this data (GDPR, 2018). This report uses recommended vulnerability scanning tools to assess the website for the potential weaknesses 
                   (Daud, 2015) discussed in the design document. </p>
                  2.0 Scanning Tools
                  Vulnerability scanning can be conducted through manual testing or available tools (Daud, 2014). For the scanning performed on allmytype.co.uk, several tools were reviewed and
                   selected based on criteria that assessed the tools' ease of use, flexibility, reputation, licensing, and ease of installation.</p>
                   <h6><b>2.1 Kali Linux </b></h6>
                   <p>Kali Linux can be installed as a virtual machine on a device allowing users access to multiple applications and frameworks (Bhatt, 2018). While some of the tools offered 
                     as part of the package are more complex and suited to experienced penetration testers, the variety available means there is also an offering for beginners with little
                      knowledge of Kali or security testing (Leroux, 2020), making the tool as straightforward or as complex as the user requires. While downloading Kali Linux from their 
                      website is not complicated, the user must first have some virtualisation  </p>
                  
                       <p> oftware to install Kali on, making the process more complex. For scanning allmytype.co.uk, Kali Linux was chosen to gain access to a range of tools. 
                        Through Kali Linux we utilised Nikto, a command-line vulnerability scanner that scans for both security vulnerabilities and misconfigured web servers. Dmitry for port 
                        scanning which is a good option for gathering as much information as possible about a host (Aar & Sharma, 2017). We combined this with Network Mapper (Nmap) a free 
                        open-source tool (Kaur & Kaur, 2017), often used for network discovery and auditing by using IP packets to determine what hosts are available (Bhingardeve & Franklin, 
                        2018).</p>

                      <h6><b>2.2 Dmitry </b></h6>
                      <p> We chose Dmitry from Kali for the information gathering scan because it can (as shown in the scan)
                       <li> A. Obtain information about an IP address by using the WHOIS lookup system,</li>
                       <li>B. Use the WHOIS tool to check the WHOIS information on a domain name, the Subdomain Finder to check the different records available, and so forth.</li>
                       <li>  C.Detect email addresses within WHOIS records or the start of authoritative DNS records and perform port scanning and banner grabbing regarding found open ports by scouring 
                        the web for 'low-hanging fruit' information.</li></p>

                      <h6><b>3.0 Vulnerabilities </b></h6>
                      <p> Our initial design document explored a potential 12 vulnerabilities that the site may be susceptible to. Once appropriate vulnerability scanning tools were selected, 
                        the vulnerabilities were explored, and the ones confirmed to exist are discussed in more detail throughout this report. We then used the Open Web Application Security 
                        Project top 10 vulnerabilities (OWASP, 2021) to rate the vulnerability according to its most critical security risks to web applications (NGINX, 2022).</p>

                      <h6><b>3.1 Broken Access Control </b></h6>

                      <p> GDPR (2018) requires allmytype.co.uk to protect the integrity confidentiality and availability of personal data, access controls must be implemented to manage who has access to the data
                         in allmytype.co.uk. Broken access control is up from fifth place in OWASP due to a number of notable Common Weakness Enumeration (CWEs). Information Disclosure to Unauthorised Personnel, 
                         GWE-201: Inserting Sensitive Data into Sent Data, and GWE-352: Access to Sent Data by Unauthorised Personnel. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). A scan of allmytype.co.uk showed the 
                         presence of the CSRF vulnerability which allows an attacker to force a user's web browser to conduct malicious activity on the site (Siddiqui & Verma, 2011).</p>
                      
                        These vulnerabilities include:
                      <li> 1. Access should only be allowed for specific capabilities, roles, or users, but is open to everybody in violation of the concept of least privilege or deny by default. </li>
                      <li> 2. Modifying the URL (parameter tampering or force browsing) or internal application state, or using an attack tool to manipulate API requests, to get around access control checks. </li>
                      <li>3. By giving a unique identity, you can read or edit someone else's account </li></p>
                      
                      
                        <h6><b>3.1.2 Mitigations </b></h6>
                       <p> 1. Deny access by default.</li> 
                       <li>  2. Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate for example, repeated failed login attempts.</li> 
                       <li>3. Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application. Access controls should enforce ownership rather than accept that the user is 
                        permitted to create, read, update, or delete any record.</li> 
                        <li> 4. Disable directory listing for the web server and ensure that backup files and file metadata are not present within the web root.</li> 
                        <li> 5. Limit API and controller access to minimise the harm from automated attack tooling.</li> 
                        <li> 6. After logging out, stateful session identifiers should be invalidated. Tokens based on stateless JWT are recommended to be short-lived in order to minimise the 
                        window of opportunity for an attacker. The OAuth revoke access standards should be followed for longer-lived JWTs.</li> 
                        </p>

                      <h6><b>3.2 Cryptographic Failures</b></h6>
                      <p> Article 32 of GDPR suggests using appropriate encryption to secure any personal information being stored or while in transit (GDPR, 2018). A Nikto scan of 
                        allmytype.co.uk revealed the Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate is encrypted, as shown in figure 5, using AEAD Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 256bit key
                         in Galois/Counter mode (AES 256 GCM) and Secure Hash Algorithm 384 (SHA384) which is more secure than other algorithms like SHA-1 (TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM, 2021). 
                        AES encryption encrypts plaintext inputs and cryptographic keys and yields an encrypted block of byte data that is decrypted by the receiver with the same key. This AES 
                        encryption supports the block cipher mode GCM which uses a cryptographic key of 128 or 256 bits in length (Google Cloud, N.D).
                        Security Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA384) produces a hash value of 384 bits as a 96-digit hexadecimal number. This helps verify if a file has been altered (WEB Tools, N.D).
                        Based on the above, the site is not likely to be vulnerable to SSL TLS attacks such as Advanced Persistent Malware, SSL Stripping Attacks, Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
                         and brute force attacks and AES is known to be more resistant to the recent quantum attacks, which makes it a preferred encryption solution (Rao et al., 2017).
                        </p>

                      <h6><b>3.3 Security misconfiguration, improper error handling and open ports  </b></h6>
                      <p> There can be security misconfigurations at any level of the application stack, including network services, platforms, web and application servers, databases, Frameworks, custom code, 
                        pre-installed virtual machines, containers, or storage. Misconfigurations, default accounts, unpatched flaws, unused access files, directories, and unprotected files, along with 
                        attackers' tactics to gain control of your systems, can be detected by automatic scanners. An attacker can exploit these flaws to gain access to certain system data or functionality, 
                        potentially compromising the whole system. As shown on the scan of allmytype.co.uk in Figure 2.</p>

                      <h6><b>3.4 Vulnerable and Outdated Components</b></h6>


                  <p>  One of the top application security threats that web developers must address, according to the OWASP 2021, is vulnerable and obsolete components (OWASP, 2021).This 
                    includes using out of support operation systems, databases, and applications as part of the website development and not ensuring identified vulnerabilities are patched.
                    The Nikto scan (Figure 5) showed the website is running on an Apache server and uses the Imunify360 web server security suite. Due to being open source and multi-platform 
                    (Vlad, 2022), Apache is one of the most popular choices of web server. In 2019, an update was released to patch CVE-2019-0211, which gave attackers full root access to the 
                    server (Narang, 2019). In 2022, Apache released an update to address CVE-2022-23943, a denial-of-service vulnerability (Moussalli, 2022). The release of updates must be kept
                     up with so as not to become susceptible to a  breach through a known vulnerability and ensure there is an appropriate process in place to alert the operations team for 
                     critical patches so as not to cause a delay (Luszcz, 2018).
                    Imunify360 offers website protection and web server security capabilities, including intrusion prevention and detection systems, network firewalls, antivirus protection,
                    and patch management. Allmytype.co.uk uses Imunify 360, a security platform designed for web hosting servers. Researchers from Cisco's Talos unit discovered that Imunify360
                     could exploit a high-severity vulnerability. A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a server using a specially crafted file. This has been reported to the vendor
                      and is now patched in a new version, 5.11.3 (Kovacs,2021.3). </p>
                     
                      <h6><b>3.4.1 Mitigations</b></h6>
                     <li> 1. Although the Apache version being used is unclear, the organisation must make sure it is patched to the latest version (2.4.46), which includes some security fixes.</li>
                    <li>2. Update with a version of Imunify360 at least 5.11.3 or higher.</li>



                      <h6><b>3.5 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</b></h6>
                      <p> The scan in figure 5 shows The X-XSS protection header is not defined. Data is sent to a web user as dynamic content without being validated to verify that it doesn't 
                        contain malicious software. XSS attacks occur when an untrusted source like a web browser enters data into a web application without validation. Web browsers typically 
                        receive malicious code in the form of JavaScript, but it can also be HTML, Flash, or any other code the browser can execute.
                        Attacks using XSS are almost limitless, but they commonly involve sending private information to the attacker and redirecting it back to the victim. An XSS attacker may
                         use the victim to access content controlled by the attacker or perform other malicious operations on the victim's machine while posing as the infected site itself. </p>

                         <p> Effective mitigation for XSS vulnerabilities will require several effective strategies including;
                          <li>1. Filter input on arrival. </li>
                        <li> 2. Encode data on output at the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content.</li>
                      <li> 3. Use proper heards to avoid XSS in answers that aren't supposed to contain any HTML or JavaScript.</li>
                          </p>
                      
                      <h6><b>4.0 Conclusion and Recommendations</b></h6>
                     <p> Whilst this report identifies a number of vulnerabilities found within allmytype.co.uk, the organisation must be aware that these may not be the only ones to exist. There were other 
                       vulnerabilities explored in the design document that have not been found due to the tools selected and the ability to test. These are, Software and Data Integrity Failures, Weak Login
                        Credentials; Insufficient Logging & Monitoring and SQL Injection. Further investigation should be done to test for these potential vulnerabilities.
                      We recommend that all of the mitigation activities mentioned throughout the report be addressed to further enhance the security of the site and to reduce the risk of personal information being 
                      disclosed to unauthorised individuals. Failure to address these vulnerabilities after being made aware of their presence could negatively affect the company's position if under investigation by
                       the ICO. 
                      Once the current risks are mitigated, we recommend the organisation stay informed of any CVEs which could affect their site and conduct regular penetration and vulnerability testing to check 
                      for new vulnerabilities that could be introduced, followed by further mitigating actions to address any findings, thus implementing a cycle of regular checks and fixes to maintain compliance 
                      with GDPR.
                       In conclusion, we deem the organisation to have implemented some technical measures to ensure the security of the website and this should be improved and then maintained.</p>

                    <h6><b>Group 2: Opening Argument 2 </b></h6>
                     <p>   Peer-to-peer has become a significant social and technical phenomenon over the past year. Today's computing and communications
                        environments are more complex and chaotic than classical distributed systems, without any centralised hierarchy or organisation.

                      Peer-to-peer networks are an excellent foundation for large-scale data sharing and multicast applications at the application level.
                     
                     These networks have the potential to be an efficient routing system, self-organising, immensely scalable, and incredibly resilient. In addition, they integrate fault tolerance, load balancing, and a clear sense of location.
                     
                     Various features are available on these Peer-to-peer networks, including selecting nearby peers, redundant storage, efficient searches and finding of data items, data permanence and authentication, hierarchical naming, and anonymity (e.g., FreeNet).
                     
                     First of all, let us take an example from BitTorrent; Users can use BitTorrent to transfer data and electronic files over the Internet using the peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. This enables users to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet decentralised. This app is available for a variety of computing platforms and operating systems.
                     
                      "Torrenting", As it is called, should be approached with caution because  BitTorrent  Peer-to-peer networking may offer a convenient way to share files. Unfortunately, it has also resulted in a great deal of software piracy and illegal downloads where modified clients may not follow the standard protocol, and data stored on remote computers may be disclosed.
                     
                     However, each new user must obtain an identity certificate digitally signed by a central authority to prove their identity. For example, a user signs a message with his private key and attaches a certificate signed by the CA. Strong identities prevent Sybil Attacks; if an attacker is caught, it cannot easily rejoin the system.</p>
