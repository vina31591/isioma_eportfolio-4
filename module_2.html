            <h4>Topic:</h4> Discuss why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security.
            
            
            <br>
            


            <h4>MY INITIAL POST</h4> 
            <p> The context of the study is on the empirical analysis of the viability demonstrates medical systems are also considered IoT systems. The research according to the authors, is to investigate the development of a methodology for assessing vulnerabilities.  </p><br>
            This action is performed through penetration tests for training purposes by students at the University of South Alabama on the istan mannequin, which is a medical mannequin that simulates respiratory, neurological and cardiovascular systems (CAE Healthcare).  </p><br>
             
            <p>The authors explained Cyber-physical threats intensively from the increasingly pervasive integration of technology into medical arenas. They were able to identify software vulnerabilities and have reported a growing number of exploitable vulnerabilities, and possible intentional failure on these istan medical mannequin security breaches are inevitable because of the long-term consequences as a result of the increasing dependence on technology. </p><br>

              <p> They also outline fundamental security concerns like medical identity theft denial of service TCP network protocol vulnerable to DOS attacks. The 802.11 wireless transmissions communicate between the mannequin and the control machines, which is vulnerable to brute force attacks (Glisson et al., 2015). This attack allows the ability to control or reprogram these medical mannequins wirelessly. This attack also performs threats to elevate user privileges by performing a brute force attack (obtaining valid user and password) and security control attacks that deny service to the software application by simulating false entry signals and potentially causing physical damage. (Glisson et al. 2015) By incorrectly analysing life-threatening critical data by medical personnel, the breach of medical training environments may impact thousands of lives in the medical profession over the long term. </p><br>
                <p>Among the first techniques to mitigate DDoS attacks is to minimise the area that can be targeted, thereby reducing the options for attackers and enabling the implementation of protections Information technology infrastructures.</p></b><br>
                          <p>The best defence against password attacks is ensuring that passwords are as strong as they can be. Multi-Factor Authentication Techniques and Honeypot systems are beneficial for detecting attackers. This requires establishing the proper authentication, privacy and confidentiality mechanisms. (Pankaj, 2005)

                            Finally, it is vital to secure the different wireless communication protocols that the istan mannequin relies on to maintain a high level of security..</p></b><br>

                  Dear Isioma,


                  Thank you for sharing, and I have always wondered why healthcare institutions were frequently the target of cyberattacks? In addition, apart from the monetary aspect of this, what other negative impacts do you see when these companies have been susceptible to cyberattacks?
                  
                  Thank you.<br>
                 <h6> <b>Reply to Bee Teck Ivan Chua</b></h6>
                 <p>Global Healthcare is becoming increasingly vulnerable to online cyber-attacks due to a lack of time and resources to educate staff about online risks. In addition, these hospitals have medical appliances made without security in mind, with an unimaginable amount of patient Confidential data. Even though medical apparatus may not store the patient data, it can pitch cyber-attacks on important information.

                  Cyber security training plays a vital role here to avoid reputational damage.
                  
                  Data protection and privacy laws are also a requirement meant to manage cybersecurity. If data is accidentally or deliberately compromised, fines and regulatory sanctions are deployed for appropriate measures.</p><br>

                   Hi Isioma

                   </p> I always find it interesting to hear people’s opinions on the WannaCry attack on the NHS. As this involved damage to patients and the care they were receiving it had a huge impact on the UK at the time. 
                   However, although this attack cost the NHS £92 million in recovery costs, they did not suffer the same from brand or reputational damage as a private organisation may have had because most people in the UK have no other choice than to use the NHS services.
                   Therefore, competitive advantage is a not an incentive for them to invest in their Cyber Security. Although it can be argued that due to the type of sensitive and medical data the NHS processes they should have stronger controls in place to protect their patients, 
                   investing more into the security of the business takes money away from medical services that need investing in as well. Do you think investment of security is as important as spending the money on more doctors, nurses, medical equipment etc?  </p><br>
             <p>
               <h6><b>  
                Reply to Elizabeth Cook</h6></b></p>
                <p>Human resources and Technology are principal health system inputs. Various factors emerge that affect investment in health care and the acquisition of security of cyberspace. 
                However, Healthcare organizations are not standing by idly; many have taken active steps to protect themselves.  The WannaCry cyber-attacks on the NHS have demonstrated the importance of a robust and evidence-based framework to combat cybercrime in the healthcare system and society in general.

                <p> However, the (NHS) Department was warned about the risks of a cyberattack a year before.  The cyber incident disrupted the health care service. It could have caused more disruption if it had not been stopped by cyber security researchers that activated the  ‘kill switch’ so that WannaCry stopped locking devices.
                
                Technology inspires healthcare more than any other influential cause, and in the future, it will continue to develop in dramatic ways.
                
                 Thus, the investment in cybersecurity is as significant as investing in healthcare, improving safety events, reporting, information sharing, end-user education training, and response to cybersecurity events must involve all parties to avoid future attacks. </p><br>

              </p> Hi Elizabeth,

              Thank you for sharing your thoughts on NHS and how the people in the UK have no other choice and there is no incentive for them to invest in Cyber security. I have a slightly different opinion from yours and the reason is the people are not going to be happy due to the disruption (even though no data were compromised due to the nature of the attack) and this may affect the political chances of the current government to win the next election. In addition, the image of NHS is also a reflection of the reputation of the government.
              
              Thanks.<p><br>

                Hi Isioma.

                 <p>To add a little to the importance of cyber security in the health sector.

                  As a result of the Covid 19 pandemic, the cyberattack has increased dramatically, affecting the health care sector, as the world health organisation alerted. The number of cyberattacks is now more than five times what it used to be before the pandemic endangering the health care industry revealing a considerable risk for health processes. However, this risk comes from people actions, technology failure that results from cyber-attacks.<p><br>
                    </p>Some healthcare providers use IoT applications to provide critical medical services such as embedded context prediction, embedded gateway configuration; indirect emergency treatment; semantic medical access; wearable device access; health information regarding children, community healthcare, and adverse drug reactions. Beneficiaries can receive these services using various medical IoT applications, such as healthcare solutions that use smartphones, wheelchair and medication management, rehabilitation systems, and systems to monitor oxygen saturation, body temperature, blood pressure and electrocardiograms; and sensing blood glucose level. These IoT applications can reduce medical services’ costs, improve the users’ experiences and serve more patients with the limited availability of healthcare resources. (WIRED Staff, 2011) However, the attack on this IOT product will hamper and significantly affect primary health care services delivery. Therefore, the importance of cybersecurity can never be overemphasised as much and greater need for the proper security of these IoT appliances.<p><br>
                    <p> 

                      <h6><b> 
                      Summary Post - Isioma Vina </h6></b></p>

                      </p>The issues and challenges around cybersecurity have increased to the context of global affairs at an unprecedented level, both online and offline; Cybersecurity is now in the public’s consciousness because this threat does not recognise international borders. As pointed out in Okafor-Tolofari, I.V (2021) initial post, the WannaCry ransomware attack has brought much attention to the importance of cybersecurity in the health care sector. Muthuppalaniappan, M. and Stevenson, K. (2020)

                      Cook, E. & kealramani, K. (2021) shared more light on how the WannaCry attack affected the UK NHS and whether the investment in cyber security should be as significant as medical personnel. Cabrera, E. (2018) also emphasised that every participation, development, and cooperation function is vital to cybersecurity. 
                     
                     The healthcare industry is now a popular target for hackers, where data is vulnerable due to massive volumes of personal data, insecure security systems, and a vast network of connected medical devices. Tolofari, S. (2021) highlighted the importance of cyber security in the health sector on the peer responses to the dramatic increase in the sophistication of cyber-crime due to the Covid 19 pandemic.
                     
                     The protection of cyberinfrastructure from hostile actors is complex and never-ending. Although, despite these constraints, cybersecurity in different organisations, be it health, business, or IT (information technology), is exceptional for safety for society because Risk assessment depends on the identification of the threat actor.
                     
                     Chua, B.T.I. and Tebogo, V. (2021) brought insightful thoughts about cybersecurity, and its cyber-crimes negative impact on companies and the importance to empower law enforcement agencies” in the pursuit of perpetrators.<p><br>
                      </p>Nevertheless, governments enact laws, like the EU law on cybercrimes, which adopted a standard policy to protect its society against cybercrime through proper legislation and fostering international cooperation.

                      In conclusion, The Engagement of different practitioners with cyber security has a great chance to reduce the risk and the impact of a range of cyber-attacks. Therefore, there is an enormous need to bring large-scale security improvement, training, and maintenance approaches to the cyber domain.<p><br>

                            <h4><b> Summary post on the collabarative learning discussion 1; a continuation of unit 1 </b></h4>
            
                            <h6><b>MY SUMMARY POST </b></h6> 
            In the initial post, Tolofari, S. (2021) related how cyberattacks could significantly affect society causing chaos and substantial financial and reputational loss to companies. A breach probably affects a company's infrastructure, like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that affected energy availability and compromised the personal information of nearly 6,000 individuals, creating disorder, confusion, and property loss(Business, 2021). According to Danialou, M.(2021), on the peer response, we are already amid a "cyber pandemic" with the number of attacks on critical infrastructures rising sharply.
            It was also Highlighted that inadequate cyber security has led to substantial economic loss to companies through litigation and fines over data breaches and violations. For example, laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Intersoft Consulting, 2018) fined British Airways through the UK's data protection authority after customer data leakage due to poor data security. Equifax incurred almost 148 million due to compromised data records (Johnson, 2021). DigiNotar, a certificate authority, went bankrupt due to the control of all eight of the company's certificate-issuing servers pinpointing the unwavering need for cyber security (Fisher, D 2012).
             The effect of cybercrime on healthcare industries in the initial post, Okafor-Tolofari, I. (2021), was extensively discussed. An example was the WannaCry Ransomware that cost the NHS £92 million in recovery. The evolution of medicine significantly depends on IoT devices to provide critical medical services. A cyber-attack that affects these facilities will result in the loss of life and jeopardy in society.
            The covid pandemic that hit the world, as agreed with Jurbe. in the peer response, has changed the way we work, with remote work and studies being the solution and an alternative to the pandemic (Jubet, 2021). Imagine a disruption of cyber activities, what catastrophe and chaos it will cause the world's economy, and its imbalance to society.
            The need for having well-trained and staffed cybersecurity professionals in business, government agencies cannot be overemphasised. A lack of it will significantly affect the business economically, cause reputational loss, and create a volatile society.</br>
