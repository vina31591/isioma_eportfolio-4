            <h4>MY INITIAL POST</h4> 
            <p> The context of the study is on the empirical analysis of the viability demonstrates medical systems are also considered IoT systems. The research according to the authors, is to investigate the development of a methodology for assessing vulnerabilities.  </p><br>
            This action is performed through penetration tests for training purposes by students at the University of South Alabama on the istan mannequin, which is a medical mannequin that simulates respiratory, neurological and cardiovascular systems (CAE Healthcare).  </p><br>
             
            <p>The authors explained Cyber-physical threats intensively from the increasingly pervasive integration of technology into medical arenas. They were able to identify software vulnerabilities and have reported a growing number of exploitable vulnerabilities, and possible intentional failure on these istan medical mannequin security breaches are inevitable because of the long-term consequences as a result of the increasing dependence on technology. </p><br>

              <p> They also outline fundamental security concerns like medical identity theft denial of service TCP network protocol vulnerable to DOS attacks. The 802.11 wireless transmissions communicate between the mannequin and the control machines, which is vulnerable to brute force attacks (Glisson et al., 2015). This attack allows the ability to control or reprogram these medical mannequins wirelessly. This attack also performs threats to elevate user privileges by performing a brute force attack (obtaining valid user and password) and security control attacks that deny service to the software application by simulating false entry signals and potentially causing physical damage. (Glisson et al. 2015) By incorrectly analysing life-threatening critical data by medical personnel, the breach of medical training environments may impact thousands of lives in the medical profession over the long term. </p><br>
                <p>Among the first techniques to mitigate DDoS attacks is to minimise the area that can be targeted, thereby reducing the options for attackers and enabling the implementation of protections Information technology infrastructures.</p></b><br>
                          <p>The best defence against password attacks is ensuring that passwords are as strong as they can be. Multi-Factor Authentication Techniques and Honeypot systems are beneficial for detecting attackers. This requires establishing the proper authentication, privacy and confidentiality mechanisms. (Pankaj, 2005)

                            Finally, it is vital to secure the different wireless communication protocols that the istan mannequin relies on to maintain a high level of security..</p></b><br>

                 <p><h6>2. Peer Response by Osarodion Samuel Tolofari</h6>

                   <p>As rightly pointed out Isioma, medical systems are also considered IoT systems. IoT, while influential and beneficial, introduces several security issues. IoT's key risks include network 
                     vulnerabilities and outdated software and firmware (Shea, 2021). they often are produced with Weak or hardcoded passwords. By default, attackers may already know the device's password. Usually,
                      passwords are easy to guess, are publicly available or cannot be changed, and are vulnerable to credential theft. One notable example of such an attack is Mirai malware. The Lack of an update process or mechanism.

                    Like many IoT devices, the medical mannequin IoT products are designed with ease of use and connectivity. Unfortunately, when hackers discover new security vulnerabilities or bugs, they become vulnerable even if they are secure at purchase. Over time, IoT devices become exposed if regular updates are not applied (Thales, 2021). <br>
                    <p>In addition to the mitigative measures, you have already stated in this discussion. To mitigate the risks associated with this device, 
                      manufacturers of the mannequin should consider policies such as password complexity, password expiration, account lockout, and one-time passwords that require users to modify credentials when setting up the device.

                      Network managers can use adapted Identity and Access Management solutions to reduce the likelihood of IoT attacks. Only signed updates and encrypted exchanges should be included for authenticity when applying updates (D Jude Hemanth, J Anitha and Tsihrintzis, 2021).</p><br>

                 <p>Hi Isioma and Osarodion,

                  Thank you for your analysis.
                  
                  Just to add to this interesting concept.
                  
                  A recent Deloitte (2018) report projects that nearly 70% of medical devices will be connected to networks by 2025. The explosion of connected medical devices now has its own internet of things (IoT) subcategory: IoMT, 
                  the internet of medical things. (Folsom, 2021) As regulatory pressure continues to grow, and with exponential growth in cyber threats, effective management of cybersecurity strategies will require integrated expertise from Clinical Engineering, IT, Quality, Regulatory and Security. (McAleer, S & Reich, D., 2016).

                  Any thoughts on this?</p>

                   Hi Isioma

                   </p> Hi Isioma, I certainly see your point about the effects of technology on medical arenas. I agree that medical systems are IoT systems. In fact, in E-healthcare, 
                   internet-connected devices are used to build the structure of Medical systems. Smart devices open up more entry points for cyber-physical threats. I would also like to add medical software vulnerabilities ranging from malware that compromises the confidentiality of patients and integrity of medical systems to DDOS attacks that interrupt the capability of medical facilities to offer care services (Nair, Tyagi and Goyal, 2019). Besides, I strongly agree that failure to mitigate security breaches of istan mannequin medical software has long-term consequences. I agree that medical identity theft permits attackers to control and reprogram medical software wirelessly. In addition, it allows attackers to acquire legal user passwords to steal insurance information and file fraudulent reports on individuals' insurance (Frankenfield, 2021). I want to add this question; what are the effective ways of preventing medical identity theft? </p><br>
             <p> I strongly agree that it is crucial to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. I certainly see your point of using the technique of implementing Protection Information Technology Infrastructures and minimizing areas that attackers can target to reduce DDOS attacks. I would also like to add that DDOS attacks slow down networks and machines, making medical systems and resources inaccessible to users (Overby, 2021). Other ways of preventing DDOS attacks include; observing and scrutinizing network traffic, fortifying software safety posture, and establishing a DDOS attack response plan. I agree that Honeypot systems and Multi-Factor Authentication Techniques are valuable for spotting software intruders. I want to add this question; what security mechanism can be used to establish confidentiality, integrity, and authentication? I agree that the istan mannequin must secure its system with diverse wireless communication protocols to uphold a high-security level. </p><br>     </p><br>

              </p> Hi Elizabeth,

              Thank you for sharing your thoughts on NHS and how the people in the UK have no other choice and there is no incentive for them to invest in Cyber security. I have a slightly different opinion from yours and the reason is the people are not going to be happy due to the disruption (even though no data were compromised due to the nature of the attack) and this may affect the political chances of the current government to win the next election. In addition, the image of NHS is also a reflection of the reputation of the government.
              
              Thanks.<p><br>

                Hi Isioma.

                 <p>To add a little to the importance of cyber security in the health sector.

                  As a result of the Covid 19 pandemic, the cyberattack has increased dramatically, affecting the health care sector, as the world health organisation alerted. The number of cyberattacks is now more than five times what it used to be before the pandemic endangering the health care industry revealing a considerable risk for health processes. However, this risk comes from people actions, technology failure that results from cyber-attacks.<p><br>
                    </p>Some healthcare providers use IoT applications to provide critical medical services such as embedded context prediction, embedded gateway configuration; indirect emergency treatment; semantic medical access; wearable device access; health information regarding children, community healthcare, and adverse drug reactions. Beneficiaries can receive these services using various medical IoT applications, such as healthcare solutions that use smartphones, wheelchair and medication management, rehabilitation systems, and systems to monitor oxygen saturation, body temperature, blood pressure and electrocardiograms; and sensing blood glucose level. These IoT applications can reduce medical services’ costs, improve the users’ experiences and serve more patients with the limited availability of healthcare resources. (WIRED Staff, 2011) However, the attack on this IOT product will hamper and significantly affect primary health care services delivery. Therefore, the importance of cybersecurity can never be overemphasised as much and greater need for the proper security of these IoT appliances.<p><br>
                    <p> 

                      <h6><b> 
                      Summary Post - Isioma Vina </h6></b></p>

                      </p>The issues and challenges around cybersecurity have increased to the context of global affairs at an unprecedented level, both online and offline; Cybersecurity is now in the public’s consciousness because this threat does not recognise international borders. As pointed out in Okafor-Tolofari, I.V (2021) initial post, the WannaCry ransomware attack has brought much attention to the importance of cybersecurity in the health care sector. Muthuppalaniappan, M. and Stevenson, K. (2020)

                      Cook, E. & kealramani, K. (2021) shared more light on how the WannaCry attack affected the UK NHS and whether the investment in cyber security should be as significant as medical personnel. Cabrera, E. (2018) also emphasised that every participation, development, and cooperation function is vital to cybersecurity. 
                     
                     The healthcare industry is now a popular target for hackers, where data is vulnerable due to massive volumes of personal data, insecure security systems, and a vast network of connected medical devices. Tolofari, S. (2021) highlighted the importance of cyber security in the health sector on the peer responses to the dramatic increase in the sophistication of cyber-crime due to the Covid 19 pandemic.
                     
                     The protection of cyberinfrastructure from hostile actors is complex and never-ending. Although, despite these constraints, cybersecurity in different organisations, be it health, business, or IT (information technology), is exceptional for safety for society because Risk assessment depends on the identification of the threat actor.
                     
                     Chua, B.T.I. and Tebogo, V. (2021) brought insightful thoughts about cybersecurity, and its cyber-crimes negative impact on companies and the importance to empower law enforcement agencies” in the pursuit of perpetrators.<p><br>
                      </p>Nevertheless, governments enact laws, like the EU law on cybercrimes, which adopted a standard policy to protect its society against cybercrime through proper legislation and fostering international cooperation.

                      In conclusion, The Engagement of different practitioners with cyber security has a great chance to reduce the risk and the impact of a range of cyber-attacks. Therefore, there is an enormous need to bring large-scale security improvement, training, and maintenance approaches to the cyber domain.<p><br>

                            <h6><b>MY SUMMARY POST </b></h6> 
            In the initial post, Tolofari, S. (2021) related how cyberattacks could significantly affect society causing chaos and substantial financial and reputational loss to companies. A breach probably affects a company's infrastructure, like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that affected energy availability and compromised the personal information of nearly 6,000 individuals, creating disorder, confusion, and property loss(Business, 2021). According to Danialou, M.(2021), on the peer response, we are already amid a "cyber pandemic" with the number of attacks on critical infrastructures rising sharply.
            It was also Highlighted that inadequate cyber security has led to substantial economic loss to companies through litigation and fines over data breaches and violations. For example, laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Intersoft Consulting, 2018) fined British Airways through the UK's data protection authority after customer data leakage due to poor data security. Equifax incurred almost 148 million due to compromised data records (Johnson, 2021). DigiNotar, a certificate authority, went bankrupt due to the control of all eight of the company's certificate-issuing servers pinpointing the unwavering need for cyber security (Fisher, D 2012).
             The effect of cybercrime on healthcare industries in the initial post, Okafor-Tolofari, I. (2021), was extensively discussed. An example was the WannaCry Ransomware that cost the NHS £92 million in recovery. The evolution of medicine significantly depends on IoT devices to provide critical medical services. A cyber-attack that affects these facilities will result in the loss of life and jeopardy in society.
            The covid pandemic that hit the world, as agreed with Jurbe. in the peer response, has changed the way we work, with remote work and studies being the solution and an alternative to the pandemic (Jubet, 2021). Imagine a disruption of cyber activities, what catastrophe and chaos it will cause the world's economy, and its imbalance to society.
            The need for having well-trained and staffed cybersecurity professionals in business, government agencies cannot be overemphasised. A lack of it will significantly affect the business economically, cause reputational loss, and create a volatile society.</br>
