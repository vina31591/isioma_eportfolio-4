            <h4>MY INITIAL POST</h4> 
            <p> The context of the study is on the empirical analysis of the viability demonstrates medical systems are also considered IoT systems. The research according to the authors, is to investigate the development of a methodology for assessing vulnerabilities.  </p><br>
            This action is performed through penetration tests for training purposes by students at the University of South Alabama on the istan mannequin, which is a medical mannequin that simulates respiratory, neurological and cardiovascular systems (CAE Healthcare).  </p><br>
             
            <p>The authors explained Cyber-physical threats intensively from the increasingly pervasive integration of technology into medical arenas. They were able to identify software vulnerabilities and have reported a growing number of exploitable vulnerabilities, and possible intentional failure on these istan medical mannequin security breaches are inevitable because of the long-term consequences as a result of the increasing dependence on technology. </p><br>

              <p> They also outline fundamental security concerns like medical identity theft denial of service TCP network protocol vulnerable to DOS attacks. The 802.11 wireless transmissions communicate between the mannequin and the control machines, which is vulnerable to brute force attacks (Glisson et al., 2015). This attack allows the ability to control or reprogram these medical mannequins wirelessly. This attack also performs threats to elevate user privileges by performing a brute force attack (obtaining valid user and password) and security control attacks that deny service to the software application by simulating false entry signals and potentially causing physical damage. (Glisson et al. 2015) By incorrectly analysing life-threatening critical data by medical personnel, the breach of medical training environments may impact thousands of lives in the medical profession over the long term. </p><br>
                <p>Among the first techniques to mitigate DDoS attacks is to minimise the area that can be targeted, thereby reducing the options for attackers and enabling the implementation of protections Information technology infrastructures.</p></b><br>
                          <p>The best defence against password attacks is ensuring that passwords are as strong as they can be. Multi-Factor Authentication Techniques and Honeypot systems are beneficial for detecting attackers. This requires establishing the proper authentication, privacy and confidentiality mechanisms. (Pankaj, 2005)

                            Finally, it is vital to secure the different wireless communication protocols that the istan mannequin relies on to maintain a high level of security..</p></b><br>

                 <h6> <b> Peer Response by Osarodion Samuel Tolofari</b></h6>

                   <p>As rightly pointed out Isioma, medical systems are also considered IoT systems. IoT, while influential and beneficial, introduces several security issues. IoT's key risks include network 
                     vulnerabilities and outdated software and firmware (Shea, 2021). they often are produced with Weak or hardcoded passwords. By default, attackers may already know the device's password. Usually,
                      passwords are easy to guess, are publicly available or cannot be changed, and are vulnerable to credential theft. One notable example of such an attack is Mirai malware. The Lack of an update process or mechanism.

                    Like many IoT devices, the medical mannequin IoT products are designed with ease of use and connectivity. Unfortunately, when hackers discover new security vulnerabilities or bugs, they become vulnerable even if they are secure at purchase. Over time, IoT devices become exposed if regular updates are not applied (Thales, 2021). <br>
                    <p>In addition to the mitigative measures, you have already stated in this discussion. To mitigate the risks associated with this device, 
                      manufacturers of the mannequin should consider policies such as password complexity, password expiration, account lockout, and one-time passwords that require users to modify credentials when setting up the device.

                      Network managers can use adapted Identity and Access Management solutions to reduce the likelihood of IoT attacks. Only signed updates and encrypted exchanges should be included for authenticity when applying updates (D Jude Hemanth, J Anitha and Tsihrintzis, 2021).</p><br>

                 <p>Hi Isioma and Osarodion,

                  Thank you for your analysis.
                  
                  Just to add to this interesting concept.
                  
                  A recent Deloitte (2018) report projects that nearly 70% of medical devices will be connected to networks by 2025. The explosion of connected medical devices now has its own internet of things (IoT) subcategory: IoMT, 
                  the internet of medical things. (Folsom, 2021) As regulatory pressure continues to grow, and with exponential growth in cyber threats, effective management of cybersecurity strategies will require integrated expertise from Clinical Engineering, IT, Quality, Regulatory and Security. (McAleer, S & Reich, D., 2016).

                  Any thoughts on this?</p>

                   Hi Isioma

                   </p> Hi Isioma, I certainly see your point about the effects of technology on medical arenas. I agree that medical systems are IoT systems. In fact, in E-healthcare, 
                   internet-connected devices are used to build the structure of Medical systems. Smart devices open up more entry points for cyber-physical threats. I would also like to add medical software vulnerabilities ranging from malware that compromises the confidentiality of patients and integrity of medical systems to DDOS attacks that interrupt the capability of medical facilities to offer care services (Nair, Tyagi and Goyal, 2019). Besides, I strongly agree that failure to mitigate security breaches of istan mannequin medical software has long-term consequences. I agree that medical identity theft permits attackers to control and reprogram medical software wirelessly. In addition, it allows attackers to acquire legal user passwords to steal insurance information and file fraudulent reports on individuals' insurance (Frankenfield, 2021). I want to add this question; what are the effective ways of preventing medical identity theft? </p><br>
             <p> I strongly agree that it is crucial to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. I certainly see your point of using the technique of implementing Protection Information Technology Infrastructures and minimizing areas that 
               attackers can target to reduce DDOS attacks. I would also like to add that DDOS attacks slow down networks and machines, making medical systems and resources inaccessible to users (Overby, 2021). 
               Other ways of preventing DDOS attacks include; observing and scrutinizing network traffic, fortifying software safety posture, and establishing a DDOS attack response plan. I agree that Honeypot systems and Multi-Factor Authentication Techniques are 
               valuable for spotting software intruders. I want to add this question; what security mechanism can be used to establish confidentiality, integrity, and authentication? I agree that the istan mannequin must secure its system with diverse 
               wireless communication protocols to uphold a high-security level. </p><br>

                       <p>Glaisson et al. (2015) review the results of two malicious attacks performed by students at the University of South Alabama. A penetration testing project that exploited a TCP network protocol vulnerability at the mannequin's internal access point and the other uses 802.11 wireless broadcasting to carry out brute force attacks.
                     
                      Tolofari, S (2022) shared more light on how many IoT devices the medical mannequin IoT products are designed for easy use and connectivity. Despite being secure at the point of purchase, hackers frequently discover new security flaws or bugs. In the absence of regular updates, 
                      IoT devices become vulnerable over time. It is correct to state that the explosion of connected medical devices now has its subcategory of the internet of things (IoT): IoMT, the internet of medical things, as regulations continue to tighten. Cybersecurity concerns are omnipresent in connected medical devices, as connected devices present additional risks for data security as the number of devices increases.</p><br>
                      <p>Necat, B & Ahamd, H (2022) shared more light on how in the era of increasing regulatory pressure and exponential cyber threat growth, managing cybersecurity strategies will require the skills of Clinical Engineering, IT, Quality, Regulatory, and Security.

                      (Ahamd2022) brought insightful thoughts about Techniques like Multi-Factor Authentication identifying software intruders and how confidentiality, integrity, and authentication is achieved by using a security mechanism To maintain a high level of security.

                      Nevertheless, As a result, there is a critical need for large-scale enhanced data security, appropriate use of Inventory control, monitoring, encrypting data, training and maintenance process of all internet of medical things.</p><br>

                            <h6><b>MY SUMMARY POST </b></h6> 
            In the initial post, Tolofari, S. (2021) related how cyberattacks could significantly affect society causing chaos and substantial financial and reputational loss to companies. A breach probably affects a company's infrastructure, like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack that affected energy availability and compromised the personal information of nearly 6,000 individuals, creating disorder, confusion, and property loss(Business, 2021). According to Danialou, M.(2021), on the peer response, we are already amid a "cyber pandemic" with the number of attacks on critical infrastructures rising sharply.
            It was also Highlighted that inadequate cyber security has led to substantial economic loss to companies through litigation and fines over data breaches and violations. For example, laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Intersoft Consulting, 2018) fined British Airways through the UK's data protection authority after customer data leakage due to poor data security. Equifax incurred almost 148 million due to compromised data records (Johnson, 2021). DigiNotar, a certificate authority, went bankrupt due to the control of all eight of the company's certificate-issuing servers pinpointing the unwavering need for cyber security (Fisher, D 2012).
             The effect of cybercrime on healthcare industries in the initial post, Okafor-Tolofari, I. (2021), was extensively discussed. An example was the WannaCry Ransomware that cost the NHS £92 million in recovery. The evolution of medicine significantly depends on IoT devices to provide critical medical services. A cyber-attack that affects these facilities will result in the loss of life and jeopardy in society.
            The covid pandemic that hit the world, as agreed with Jurbe. in the peer response, has changed the way we work, with remote work and studies being the solution and an alternative to the pandemic (Jubet, 2021). Imagine a disruption of cyber activities, what catastrophe and chaos it will cause the world's economy, and its imbalance to society.
            The need for having well-trained and staffed cybersecurity professionals in business, government agencies cannot be overemphasised. A lack of it will significantly affect the business economically, cause reputational loss, and create a volatile society.</br>

            1.0 Introduction
            Any organisation using a website must take appropriate steps to ensure its security (Thia & Hieu, 2019). This is vital to prevent an attack that could compromise the website and to ensure compliance with governing bodies and regulations. Following a review of https://allmytype.co.uk, this report identifies the applicable regulations, intended audience, and information held on the site and then assesses the potential vulnerabilities, risks and how these can be mitigated.
            
            2.0 Governing Bodies and Regulation
            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); All UK organisations must abide by GDPR when processing personal information (ICO, 2018).
            Personal data must be secured by appropriate technical measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the systems.
            Consent must be given for the use of personal data, and the right to be forgotten must be met.
            The information must be used in a manner that is fair, lawful and transparent, for specified, explicit purposes, be limited to what is necessary and kept for no longer than needed. (Gov.UK, 2018). 
            Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy; protects against cybersquatting (ICANN.org, 2016)
            The Intellectual Property Office guides UK Copyright law; Owners found by the courts to be infringing copyright can be fined and or imprisoned (Intellectual Property Office, 2011).
            
            
            3.0 Intended audience and functionality
            The website is publicly available to anyone who has the URL. The website administrator can log into the site, and users can enter names and comments. Visitors may submit their email addresses to subscribe to posts; their email may be held, which is classed as personal information (ICO, 2018).
            
            Emails must only be sent to those who opt-in to receive them (including newsletters, sales or not). To maintain compliance with GDPR, users must have the ability to unsubscribe from blog emails after signing up. Most email software will do this automatically, but you must not remove the 'unsubscribe' link by accident. Subscribers should be able to easily unsubscribe themselves from your email list by following simple steps.
