            <br>


            <h4>MY INITIAL POST</h4> 
            <p> Cybersecurity is a global affair that requires international collaboration to safeguard cyberspace. The increase in Cyber threats is a significant risk to the global economy. </p><br>
              Without Cybersecurity, the defence against data breaches, malware, Phishing, and other cyber-crimes; makes cyberspace desirable targets for cybercriminals. For example, the 2018 WannaCry ransomware attack, estimated 40% of worldwide healthcare institutions, paid an estimated £92 million due to a combination of ransoms and activities.  </p><br>
             
            <p>Also, on 9 November 2021, The Spanish beer maker DAMM in Barcelona haltered production after a cyber-attack where the plant that produces a staggering 7 million hectolitres of beer a year was hacked. However, the famous Estrella Damm lager did not say if a ransom was required or paid to the cybercriminals.

              <p> Therefore, the importance of cyber systems security cannot be overstated. 
                </p>Consequently, it is of the essence to protect sensitive personal data, governmental and industry information systems. </p><br>
                <p>To preserve the global trust of cyberspace and the avoidance of excessive

                          breaches, the protection of digital identities is a swift necessity. Having a well-executed plan reviewed is the first step to keeping information safe.</p></b><br>

                  Dear Isioma,


                  Thank you for sharing, and I have always wondered why healthcare institutions were frequently the target of cyberattacks? In addition, apart from the monetary aspect of this, what other negative impacts do you see when these companies have been susceptible to cyberattacks?
                  
                  Thank you.<br>
                 <h6> <b>Reply to Bee Teck Ivan Chua</b></h6>
                 <p>Global Healthcare is becoming increasingly vulnerable to online cyber-attacks due to a lack of time and resources to educate staff about online risks. In addition, these hospitals have medical appliances made without security in mind, with an unimaginable amount of patient Confidential data. Even though medical apparatus may not store the patient data, it can pitch cyber-attacks on important information.

                  Cyber security training plays a vital role here to avoid reputational damage.
                  
                  Data protection and privacy laws are also a requirement meant to manage cybersecurity. If data is accidentally or deliberately compromised, fines and regulatory sanctions are deployed for appropriate measures.</p><br>

                   Hi Isioma

                   </p> I always find it interesting to hear people’s opinions on the WannaCry attack on the NHS. As this involved damage to patients and the care they were receiving it had a huge impact on the UK at the time. 
                   However, although this attack cost the NHS £92 million in recovery costs, they did not suffer the same from brand or reputational damage as a private organisation may have had because most people in the UK have no other choice than to use the NHS services.
                   Therefore, competitive advantage is a not an incentive for them to invest in their Cyber Security. Although it can be argued that due to the type of sensitive and medical data the NHS processes they should have stronger controls in place to protect their patients, 
                   investing more into the security of the business takes money away from medical services that need investing in as well. Do you think investment of security is as important as spending the money on more doctors, nurses, medical equipment etc?  </p><br>
             <p>

                Reply to Elizabeth Cook</h6></b></p>
                <p>Human resources and Technology are principal health system inputs. Various factors emerge that affect investment in health care and the acquisition of security of cyberspace. 
                However, Healthcare organizations are not standing by idly; many have taken active steps to protect themselves.  The WannaCry cyber-attacks on the NHS have demonstrated the importance of a robust and evidence-based framework to combat cybercrime in the healthcare system and society in general.

                <p> However, the (NHS) Department was warned about the risks of a cyberattack a year before.  The cyber incident disrupted the health care service. It could have caused more disruption if it had not been stopped by cyber security researchers that activated the  ‘kill switch’ so that WannaCry stopped locking devices.
                
                Technology inspires healthcare more than any other influential cause, and in the future, it will continue to develop in dramatic ways.
                
                 Thus, the investment in cybersecurity is as significant as investing in healthcare, improving safety events, reporting, information sharing, end-user education training, and response to cybersecurity events must involve all parties to avoid future attacks. </p><br>

              </p> Hi Elizabeth,

              Thank you for sharing your thoughts on NHS and how the people in the UK have no other choice and there is no incentive for them to invest in Cyber security. I have a slightly different opinion from yours and the reason is the people are not going to be happy due to the disruption (even though no data were compromised due to the nature of the attack) and this may affect the political chances of the current government to win the next election. In addition, the image of NHS is also a reflection of the reputation of the government.
              
              Thanks.<p><br>

                Hi Isioma.

                 <p>To add a little to the importance of cyber security in the health sector.

                  As a result of the Covid 19 pandemic, the cyberattack has increased dramatically, affecting the health care sector, as the world health organisation alerted. The number of cyberattacks is now more than five times what it used to be before the pandemic endangering the health care industry revealing a considerable risk for health processes. However, this risk comes from people actions, technology failure that results from cyber-attacks.<p><br>
                    </p>Some healthcare providers use IoT applications to provide critical medical services such as embedded context prediction, embedded gateway configuration; indirect emergency treatment; semantic medical access; wearable device access; health information regarding children, community healthcare, and adverse drug reactions. Beneficiaries can receive these services using various medical IoT applications, such as healthcare solutions that use smartphones, wheelchair and medication management, rehabilitation systems, and systems to monitor oxygen saturation, body temperature, blood pressure and electrocardiograms; and sensing blood glucose level. These IoT applications can reduce medical services’ costs, improve the users’ experiences and serve more patients with the limited availability of healthcare resources. (WIRED Staff, 2011) However, the attack on this IOT product will hamper and significantly affect primary health care services delivery. Therefore, the importance of cybersecurity can never be overemphasised as much and greater need for the proper security of these IoT appliances.<p><br>

                            <p> The issues and challenges around cybersecurity have increased to the context of global affairs at an unprecedented level, both online and offline; Cybersecurity is now in the public’s consciousness because this threat does not recognise international borders. As pointed out in Okafor-Tolofari, I.V (2021) initial post, the WannaCry ransomware attack has brought much attention to the importance of cybersecurity in the health care sector. Muthuppalaniappan, M. and Stevenson, K. (2020)</p><br>

                            <p>Cook, E. & kealramani, K. (2021) shared more light on how the WannaCry attack affected the UK NHS and whether the investment in cyber security should be as significant as medical personnel. Cabrera, E. (2018) also emphasised that every participation, development, and cooperation function is vital to cybersecurity. 
                           
                           The healthcare industry is now a popular target for hackers, where data is vulnerable due to massive volumes of personal data, insecure security systems, and a vast network of connected medical devices. Tolofari, S. (2021) highlighted the importance of cyber security in the health sector on the peer responses to the dramatic increase in the sophistication of cyber-crime due to the Covid 19 pandemic.</p><br>
                           
                           <p>The protection of cyberinfrastructure from hostile actors is complex and never-ending. Although, despite these constraints, cybersecurity in different organisations, be it health, business, or IT (information technology), is exceptional for safety for society because Risk assessment depends on the identification of the threat actor.
                           
                           Chua, B.T.I. and Tebogo, V. (2021) brought insightful thoughts about cybersecurity, and its cyber-crimes negative impact on companies and the importance to empower law enforcement agencies” in the pursuit of perpetrators.</p><br>
                           
                           <p>Nevertheless, governments enact laws, like the EU law on cybercrimes, which adopted a standard policy to protect its society against cybercrime through proper legislation and fostering international cooperation.
                           
                           In conclusion, The Engagement of different practitioners with cyber security has a great chance to reduce the risk and the impact of a range of cyber-attacks. Therefore, there is an enormous need to bring large-scale security improvement, training, and maintenance approaches to the cyber domain.</br>
