                </summary>
                <p> Cybersecurity is a global affair that requires international collaboration to safeguard cyberspace.
                  The increase in Cyber threats is a significant risk to the global economy.</p>
                <p>Without Cybersecurity, the defence against data breaches, malware, Phishing, and other cyber-crimes;
                  makes
                  cyberspace desirable targets for cybercriminals. For example, the 2018 WannaCry ransomware attack,
                  estimated 40% of worldwide healthcare institutions, paid an estimated £92 million due to a combination
                  of
                  ransoms and activities. </p>
                <p>Also, on 9 November 2021, The Spanish beer maker DAMM in Barcelona haltered production after a
                  cyber-attack where the plant that produces a staggering 7 million hectolitres of beer a year was
                  hacked.
                  However, the famous Estrella Damm lager did not say if a ransom was required or paid to the
                  cybercriminals.</p>
                <p> Therefore, the importance of cyber systems security cannot be overstated.</p>
                <p>Consequently, it is of the essence to protect sensitive personal data, governmental and industry
                  information systems. </p>
                <p>To preserve the global trust of cyberspace and the avoidance of excessive
                  breaches, the protection of digital identities is a swift necessity. Having a well-executed plan
                  reviewed is the first step to keeping information safe.</p>

                  Dear Isioma,
                  Thank you for sharing, and I have always wondered why healthcare institutions were frequently the
                  target
                  of cyberattacks? In addition, apart from the monetary aspect of this, what other negative impacts do
                  you
                  see when these companies have been susceptible to cyberattacks?
                  Thank you.
                </p>
                <h6> <b>Reply to Bee Teck Ivan Chua</b></h6>
                <p>Global Healthcare is becoming increasingly vulnerable to online cyber-attacks due to a lack of time
                  and
                  resources to educate staff about online risks. In addition, these hospitals have medical appliances
                  made
                  without security in mind, with an unimaginable amount of patient Confidential data. Even though
                  medical
                  apparatus may not store the patient data, it can pitch cyber-attacks on important information.

                  Cyber security training plays a vital role here to avoid reputational damage.

                  Data protection and privacy laws are also a requirement meant to manage cybersecurity. If data is
                  accidentally or deliberately compromised, fines and regulatory sanctions are deployed for appropriate
                  measures.</p>

                Hi Isioma

                <p> I always find it interesting to hear people’s opinions on the WannaCry attack on the NHS. As this
                  involved damage to patients and the care they were receiving it had a huge impact on the UK at the
                  time.
                  However, although this attack cost the NHS £92 million in recovery costs, they did not suffer the same
                  from brand or reputational damage as a private organisation may have had because most people in the UK
                  have no other choice than to use the NHS services.
                  Therefore, competitive advantage is a not an incentive for them to invest in their Cyber Security.
                  Although it can be argued that due to the type of sensitive and medical data the NHS processes they
                  should
                  have stronger controls in place to protect their patients,
                  investing more into the security of the business takes money away from medical services that need
                  investing in as well. Do you think investment of security is as important as spending the money on
                  more
                  doctors, nurses, medical equipment etc? </p>
                <p>
                <h6><b>Reply to Elizabeth Cook</h6></b></p>
                <p>Human resources and Technology are principal health system inputs. Various factors emerge that affect
                  investment in health care and the acquisition of security of cyberspace.
                  However, Healthcare organizations are not standing by idly; many have taken active steps to protect
                  themselves. The WannaCry cyber-attacks on the NHS have demonstrated the importance of a robust and
                  evidence-based framework to combat cybercrime in the healthcare system and society in general.</p>

                <p> However, the (NHS) Department was warned about the risks of a cyberattack a year before. The cyber
                  incident disrupted the health care service. It could have caused more disruption if it had not been
                  stopped by cyber security researchers that activated the 'kill switch' so that WannaCry stopped
                  locking
                  devices.

                  Technology inspires healthcare more than any other influential cause, and in the future, it will
                  continue to develop in dramatic ways.

                  Thus, the investment in cybersecurity is as significant as investing in healthcare, improving safety
                  events, reporting, information sharing, end-user education training, and response to cybersecurity
                  events must involve all parties to avoid future attacks. </p>

                <p> Hi Elizabeth,

                  Thank you for sharing your thoughts on NHS and how the people in the UK have no other choice and there
                  is
                  no incentive for them to invest in Cyber security. I have a slightly different opinion from yours and
                  the
                  reason is the people are not going to be happy due to the disruption (even though no data were
                  compromised
                  due to the nature of the attack) and this may affect the political chances of the current government
                  to
                  win the next election. In addition, the image of NHS is also a reflection of the reputation of the
                  government.

                  Thanks.</p>

                  Hi Isioma.

                <p>To add a little to the importance of cyber security in the health sector.

                  As a result of the Covid 19 pandemic, the cyberattack has increased dramatically, affecting the health
                  care sector, as the world health organisation alerted. The number of cyberattacks is now more than
                  five
                  times what it used to be before the pandemic endangering the health care industry revealing a
                  considerable risk for health processes. However, this risk comes from people actions, technology
                  failure
                  that results from cyber-attacks. Some healthcare providers use IoT applications to provide critical
                  medical services such as embedded
                  context prediction, embedded gateway configuration; indirect emergency treatment; semantic medical
                  access;
                  wearable device access; health information regarding children, community healthcare, and adverse drug
                  reactions. Beneficiaries can receive these services using various medical IoT applications, such as
                  healthcare solutions that use smartphones, wheelchair and medication management, rehabilitation
                  systems,
                  and systems to monitor oxygen saturation, body temperature, blood pressure and electrocardiograms; and

                  users’
                  experiences and serve more patients with the limited availability of healthcare resources. (WIRED
                  Staff,

                  services delivery. Therefore, the importance of cybersecurity can never be overemphasised as much and
                  greater need for the proper security of these IoT appliances.

                </summary>
                <p>The aim and reflection of this units is on Shell Global Data Protection legislation, Standard and ethical.
                  Shell group of companies has adopted a binding Corporate Rules which provides privacy compliance
                  framework
                  and developing awareness of the implications of security breaches and valuated available techniques
                  and
                  technologies at database and metadata levels dealing with privacy and data disclosure.
                </p>
                 <p> According to my findings Depending on the severity of the attack, a cyber attack can cost
                    between $57 and 109 billion, according to Daniel Castro, Vice-President of the Information
                     Technology & Innovation Foundation. The study found that 36% of all businesses worldwide 
                     lose all their money to cyber attacks. On average, the loss per year is estimated to be 
                     $79,841. In most cases, people tend to think their company is too small to be affected by
                      cyber security threats, and this is where they make a mistake that turns the tables 
                      upside down. </p>

                <p>This seminar was intended to examine the security concerns of Shell Global, find examples of how it
                   has dealt with such concerns and compare it with those of other international businesses by 
                   conducting a case study on the company. As part of the discussion, we also discussed the difficulties
                    Cyber professionals might face at a large company or in a small company.On security consideration for
                     a global company with the case study of shell global with branches across various continents.
                  This seminar shed more light on the various challenges companies encounter due to cyber threats and
                  due to global presence, confronting different legislative and regulatory laws that they must comply with to
                  operate in these countries.
                  This company had a breach due to a legacy system and how they managed the incident and changed
                  policies
                  to
                  prevent such incidents from occurring again.</p>

                <h6><b>MY SUMMARY POST </b></h6>
                <p> The issues and challenges around cybersecurity have increased to the context of global affairs at an
                  unprecedented level, both online and offline; Cybersecurity is now in the public’s consciousness
                  because
                  this threat does not recognise international borders. As pointed out in Okafor-Tolofari, I.V (2021)
                  initial post, the WannaCry ransomware attack has brought much attention to the importance of
                  cybersecurity in the health care sector. Muthuppalaniappan, M. and Stevenson, K. (2020)</p>

                <p>Cook, E. & kealramani, K. (2021) shared more light on how the WannaCry attack affected the UK NHS and
                  whether the investment in cyber security should be as significant as medical personnel. Cabrera, E.
                  (2018) also emphasised that every participation, development, and cooperation function is vital to
                  cybersecurity.

                  The healthcare industry is now a popular target for hackers, where data is vulnerable due to massive
                  volumes of personal data, insecure security systems, and a vast network of connected medical devices.
                  Tolofari, S. (2021) highlighted the importance of cyber security in the health sector on the peer
                  responses to the dramatic increase in the sophistication of cyber-crime due to the Covid 19 pandemic.
                </p>

                <p>The protection of cyberinfrastructure from hostile actors is complex and never-ending. Although,
                  despite these constraints, cybersecurity in different organisations, be it health, business, or IT
                  (information technology), is exceptional for safety for society because Risk assessment depends on the
                  identification of the threat actor.

                  Chua, B.T.I. and Tebogo, V. (2021) brought insightful thoughts about cybersecurity, and its
                  cyber-crimes
                  negative impact on companies and the importance to empower law enforcement agencies” in the pursuit of
                  perpetrators.</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, governments enact laws, like the EU law on cybercrimes, which adopted a standard policy
                  to protect its society against cybercrime through proper legislation and fostering international
                  cooperation.
                  In conclusion, The Engagement of different practitioners with cyber security has a great chance to
                  reduce the risk and the impact of a range of cyber-attacks. Therefore, there is an enormous need to
                  bring large-scale security improvement, training, and maintenance approaches to the cyber domain.</p>

                                <p>Cyber-only systems, cyber-physical systems, and pure physical systems can all be modeled 
                                  using attack trees, one of the oldest and most widely used methods for modeling threats. 
                                  The attack tree method was initially applied standalone, but has since been incorporated into other
                                   methods and frameworks, such as STRIDE, PASTA, and CVSS.</p>

                                  Attack trees are diagrams depicting attacks on a system in tree form; the root represents the 
                                  attack's goal, and the leaves indicate the methods it uses to accomplish that goal. Each goal should
                                   have a different tree, resulting in a set of attack trees that represent the threat analysis.</p>

              <p>Data Loss Prevention And Anti-malware in security System </p>
              <p>The data loss prevention system and Anti-malware software are technological solutions that enable any
                IT infrastructure to conduct critical processes once installed.
                It detects and stops malicious and unwanted executable files while reducing the risk of exposing
                sensitive information from leaving or entering the corporate network and from users uploading
                information or data from the web, sending sensitive data out by e-mail, or transferring sensitive data
                to removable devices</p>
              <p>Taking a step into a security operations centre where Data Loss Prevention and anti-malware solutions
                analyse, investigate, escalate events and provide consistent remediation.
                The need for Data Loss Prevention is to reduce the risk of accidental data breaches and the range of
                security issues that exist through all the layers of an IT infrastructure. The security objective is
                to
                preserve an organisation network's privacy, accessibility, and accountability. </p>
              <p>66.2% of business users have sent e-mails erroneously; most incidents of this sort are human-caused
                errors or carelessness, making countermeasures challenging to contain. (Tomoyoshi et al., 2010),</p>
              <p>Similarly, the causes of information and data loss have become progressively assorted; prevalent
                mediums such as social networking sites and instant messenger gives channels for information misuse.
                At
                the same time, the expanded drive towards flexible working has caused a noteworthy development in
                versatile gadgets being able to put away vast volumes of information from the network. </p>
              <p>Moreover, the Anti-malware software creates protection for information technology systems from
                malicious software and content analysis in real-time. Thereby detecting and blocking sensitive data
                and
                malware while in use (endpoint action), in-motion (network traffic) and at rest (data storage).
                (Securosis, L.L.C., 2010)

                Data loss prevention and Anti-malware solutions protect data and provide software security, which
                requires systematic effort with the rise of modern information security systems. Organisations ought
                to
                survey new solutions and supplant bequest systems. (Capone, 2019) However, to effectively manage data
                loss prevention and Anti-malware, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines
                and other standard organisations provide the controls needed.</p>

              <h4><b>Database Design and Implementation</b></h4>
              <div>Database information systems is the most common types of data or databases asit is called in operations,  which is an
                organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer
                system. To explainn further there are different phase of database design. </p></div>
                <h6><b>Conceptual design</b></h6>
                  <p> A conceptual database plan should be created as soon as all data requirements are stored and analyzed. The conceptual database model is highly layered. During this phase, the conceptual design is developed.

                    A basic data modeling operation can be implemented in the conceptual design phase to identify and define the high-level user operations that are evident during analysis of the functions.</p>
                <h6><b>Logical Design</b></h6>
                       <p>Similarly, the data modeling mapping phase is known as the logical phase of database design. Through this phase, we attain the result of the relation schema. Class diagrams serve as the basis for these schemas.

                        The process of creating relation schemas is mainly mechanical. Rules exist for converting an ER model or class diagram into a relation schema.</p>
                <h6><b>Normalization</b></h6>
                      <p>Database normalization is the process of changing the relation schema to reduce any superfluous information. During each phase of normalization, a new table is added to the database.</p>
                <h6><b>Physical Design</b></h6>
                  <p>Physical design is the last phase of database design. The database design is implemented during this phase. DBMS (Database Management System) is required here.</p>
                <h6><b>Skills developed</b></h6>

                <b>Abstract</b></h6>

                <p>Secure appointment scheduling information management system is increasingly becoming a must-have
                  technology for service-based Organisations. Integrating these cutting-edge technologies into an
                  existing
                  complicated Information technology infrastructure poses additional security issues for data protection
                  and
                  cybersecurity. Booking an appointment online has grown over the years as a web-based online
                  appointment
                  management system makes appointments accessible. The appointment scheduling system tracks
                  appointments,
                  reschedule appointments based on constraints, resolves conflicts, and manages all interactions. It
                  allows
                  patients to check and communicate with their doctors at their convenience.
                  An online appointment management system allows patients to register and book their appointments with
                  their
                  doctors, and the system best determines which specialist is available in each case. This system helps
                  lessen the burden of waiting for information at the help desk or the clinical staff. In addition, the
                  appointment scheduling software cancels visiting hours appointments in case any changes occur through
                  e-mails. Logging in and registering is displayed on the home page, patients (users)must login to
                  access
                  their account, using either their names, e-mail address and password.
                </p>

                <h6><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h6>

                <p>Most aspects of online appointment management, such as reservations, cancellations and confirmations,
                  are
                  controlled automatically. The web-based appointment and scheduling management information system is
                  intended to satisfy the growing population. This software can be accessed 24/7, providing an efficient
                  way
                  of related clinical tasks and avoiding the queue in enhancing doctor timetable management. Since
                  patient
                  satisfaction is of utmost importance, notifications and reminders are sent to all patients through
                  letters
                  or e-mails to prevent false appointments scheduling.
                  The Network and Information Security Directive (N.I.S.D.) 2016/1148/E.U. and the European Union’s
                  General
                  Data Protection Regulations among others compels all organisations working with citizens personal data
                  to
                  manage and process that data under strict guidelines must be taken into account. The General Data
                  Protection Regulations (GDPR) governs every data an organisation collects across credible platforms of
                  identifiable living individuals. The GDPR is a complicated policy, and there are consequences if any
                  organisation are found wanting on these policies. (Argaw et al., 2020).</p>

                <p>Lately, there have been countless diverse tendencies in cybercrime on web-based appointment and
                  scheduling management information systems. The frequency of data breaches is alarming. Therefore
                  threat
                  modeling is a crucial aspect of the web based appointment scheduling information management, aiming at
                  software and hardware security in reducing potential threats through identifying and prioritising
                  threat.
                  Web-based appointment and scheduling management software should be implemented using </p>
                <p>threat modeling system like STIRDE. It gives the security team an edge in tracking and combating
                  unintentional or malicious activities.
                  Queens Medical Centre general objectives are concerned about the current high rate of cybercrime and
                  the
                  government’s policy on patient data protection. There is a lot to acknowledge regarding web-based
                  appointment and scheduling management information systems, which should be designed applying only
                  trusted
                  software. Medical records based on patient history, personal health information containing
                  individuals’
                  medical files and digital radiography electronic data, these pieces of information are delivered
                  through
                  an internal and external network that serves as a medium of communication that includes confidential
                  data
                  such as name, date of birth, health and genetic information, insurance and health.
                  Despite these constraints, the system needs to keep patients, Doctors, appointments. Using a web-based
                  application, users or patient’s login to Queens medical centre, the appointment Scheduling System
                  records
                  all the I.P. addresses of the login section. These Login sessions and all information are stored in
                  the
                  database. Therefore, making it easy to track the user’s details from the web in case of a cyber
                  incident.
                  The concern on patient information confidentiality may arise due to general security issues.
                  Cybersecurity
                  professionals at Queens Medical Centre must consider that most medical devices introduce numerous
                  vulnerabilities in a hospital’s system security.
                  The most prevalent point of compromise is e-mail. Common instances are phishing attacks that aim to
                  collect patients’ credentials and clinical personnel’s login passwords through e-mail or harvesting.
                  Numberless attackers research websites for e-mail addresses and other contact information through
                  active
                  reconnaissance. They feed their spam machines in the hopes of finding easy targets. The Security
                  Development Lifecycle includes threat modeling as an essential component.
                  The STRIDE threat model provides an evocative procedure for security threats developed by Praerit Garg
                  and
                  Loren Kohn Felder at Microsoft are expatiated into the following steps.</p>

                <p>• Spoofing</p>
                <p>• Tampering</p>
                <p>• Repudiation</p>
                <p>• Information disclosure (privacy breach or data leak)</p>
                <p>• Denial of service</p>
                <p>• Elevation of privilege</p>

                <h6><b>Technological analysis </b></h6>

                <p>The objective viewpoint of this threat model is to secure potential security vulnerabilities and
                  needs
                  to
                  be constantly reviewed. Cybercriminals can gain access into any system through various means, Remote
                  access portals, the network, Users, Mobile devices, E-mail, and Web applications. As earlier
                  mentioned,
                  Phishing attack; is an attack vector that threatens data safety. It is a technique that a malicious
                  attacker uses to steal user’s credentials.
                  Therefore, it is imperative to install a secure web-based appointment and scheduling management
                  information system. The following characteristics should be considered essential while employing the
                  STRIDE Threat Model to the web-based appointment and scheduling information management system for
                  Queens
                  medical.</p>

                <p>• Patient-focused computing that is easy to use and maintain.</p>
                <p>• Provide integrated cross-platform support and browser compatibility</p>
                <p>• Staff awareness and training</p>
                <p>• Input validation testing application for compliance to standard</p>
                <p>• Developed mechanisms and structures to handle complaints and procedures.</p>
                <p>• The E-mail link should have a redirect application for password reset in case of compromise.</p>
                <p>• Rapid response to cyber threats</p>
                <p>STRIDE Threat Model Examine each component’s vulnerability to threats and has the following
                  characteristics and breaches of basic security standards. </p>

                <h6><b>SPOOFING </b></h6>
                <p>Spoofing refers to the act of posing as someone else, where an attacker can forge its identity to
                  masquerade as another by creating an illegitimate identity like falsifying or modifying its MAC
                  address
                  to
                  another device. E-mail spoofing is used to lure patients into disclosing personal information or
                  harvesting patients’ credentials. Through tactics like de-authentication attack, where the attacker
                  forges
                  its sender address, a technique commonly used to hide the origin of their e-mails and manipulate
                  accounts
                  to maintain access to victim systems. </p>

                <h6><b>MITIGATIONS </b></h6>

                <p>• Multi-factor authentication: Using a strong password policy.</p>
                <p>Patients must be authenticated by the software.</p>
                <p>• Utilise anti-spoofing and e-mail verification components to channel messages based on legitimacy
                  checks
                  of the sender space and integrity of messages.</p>

                <p>• Active monitoring of social media activities related to your organisation.</p>
                <p>• Segment operational assets to ensure strict isolation of critical control information within the
                  control environment.</p>
                <p>• User Training: staffs should be trained to identify social engineering techniques attempts.</p>
                <p>• Making e-mail secure, the secure socket layer (SSL) is a safe way of sending encrypted information,
                  which is more secured than a conversational paper-based referral that an attacker can intercept.</p>

                <h6><b>TAMPERING </b></h6>
                <p>Is a security threat that refers to the unauthorised modification of data to gain control over a
                  system
                  or database. Tampering could either be:
                <p>(1) Physical Tampering and</p>
                <p>(2) Network Tempering,</p>
                Both Physical and network tempering deal with intentionally modifying data.
                The threat actor intends to alter data in transit, data at rest or data in use; an unauthorised intruder
                could gather information, intercept a data packet, and change its destination data in transit, with data

                <h6><b>MITIGATIONS </b></h6>
                <p>Monitor and evaluate electronic transactions to support the integrity of the network and application
                </p>

                <p>• Security operations: Monitor the performance of various system security functions to ensure proper
                  procedures.</p>
                <p>• Minimum privileges must be assigned to users. With the least privileges and division of duties
                  protocols, appropriate access control techniques such as role-based access control (RBAC) must be
                  installed. (“Threat Modeling for Mobile Health Systems - HHS.gov”)</p>
                <p>• Secure protocols for communications must be put in place to ensure the integrity and
                  confidentiality
                  of
                  all communication at Queens Medical Centre.</p>
                <p>• Domain administrator accounts should not be utilized for daily operations, it may expose the
                  account
                  to
                  unprivileged systems.</p>
                <p>The below diagram illustrates how a tampering attack works all the way into disrupting the production
                  process of an automated production system.</p>

                <h6><b>REPUDIATION: </b></h6>
                <p>Is the denial of a particular action related to e-transactions. For example, electronic
                  communications,
                  information that contains users' personal data and staff data. Authorised users can perform illegal
                  operations, and the system cannot trace this information back to them. Information must be treated
                  with
                  confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation.</p>

                <h6><b>MITIGATION </b></h6>
                <p>• Accountability and non-repudiation systems to track and link actions.</p>
                <p>• Secure audit of all sensitive data must be logged and recorded.</p>
                <p>• A digital signature should be used for entity identification, authentication and integrity of a
                  message, to avoid attackers communicating remotely with the selected target.</p>

                <p>• Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.</p>

                <h6><b>INFORMATION DISCLOSURE </b></h6>

                <p>Is a data breach or information leakage; this allows malicious attackers to gather valuable
                  information
                  and reveal sensitive information of a patient’s medical history after obtaining valuable knowledge
                  through
                  active reconnaissance (attack.mitre.org, n.d.). Technological innovation presents a unique security
                  challenge where Mobile devices are difficult to control in any organisation network because most are
                  utilised for personal communications and can be linked to vulnerabilities like unpatched software
                  installed on the mobile device or theft of the device that might land on the hands of adversaries
                  creating
                  a point for credential harvest.</p>


                <h6><b>MITIGATION </b></h6>
                <p>Ascertain that proper access control mechanisms are in place and that only authorised users have
                  access
                  to these data.</p>
                <p>• Ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted</p>
                <p>• Ascertain that message confidentiality standards protect all communication channels.</p>
                <p>• Ascertain that proper access control mechanisms are in place and that only authorised users have
                  access
                  to data.</p>

                <h6><b>DENIAL OF SERVICE </b></h6>

                <p>Is a type of cyber-attack that aims to bring a system or network to a halt, rendering network
                  resources
                  unusable or inaccessible to their intended users. Here attackers intend to Disrupt the proper
                  functioning
                  or the availability of the appointment system by targeting the infrastructure with a flood of Internet
                  traffic and distract the incident response team. Attackers identify the vulnerability in the network
                  through multiple compromised systems and which systems can be exploited and controlled remotely to
                  exploit
                  the clinical security system.</p>
                <h6><b>MITIGATION </b></h6>
                <p>• Ensure step-by-step instructions on reacting to a DDoS attack and ensure Endpoint security that
                  provides network endpoints.</p>

                <p>• Web security tools should be installed to remove web-based threats, block abnormal traffic, and
                  search
                  for known attack signatures.</p>
                <p>• Network segmentation should be implemented to protect the network from DDOS attacks (separates
                  systems
                  into subnets)</p>
                <p>• Continuous Monitoring of Network Traffic</p>

                <h6><b>ELEVATION OF PRIVILEGES </b></h6>
                <p>Elevation of privilege attacks allegedly uses security flaws to gain access to a network and
                  applications. The attacker tries to gain access to a lower account like a user through phishing attack
                  and
                  uses the compromised account to gain a higher-level privilege.
                  This could be described as the most threatening of the STRIDE framework as users, being the weakest
                  link
                  in the security chain. This can be possible over a regular user’s account on the network and then
                  attempts
                  to gain administrative permissions. To ultimately steal users’ information from the data base of the
                  ASMIS.</p>

                <h6><b>MITIGATION </b></h6>
                <p>• Applications with known vulnerabilities should not have set user identity on execution or the "set
                  user
                  identity. bits" set to reduce the potential damage if they are compromised. </p>
                <p>Users should be removed from the local administrator group on systems and the most pressing data
                  protection issues should be addressed.</p>
                <p>• Monitor the file system for files that have malicious signatures.</p>
                <p>• Files should be encrypted such that passwords are always required. (attack.mitre.org, n.d.)</p>
                <p>• “Develop a robust cyber threat intelligence capability to determine what types and levels of threat
                  may
                  use software exploits and 0-days against a particular organization”. (attack.mitre.org, n.d.)</p>

                <h6><b>CONCLUSION </b></h6>
                <p>Adopting innovative technology to improve solutions offers operational excellence opportunities to
                  increase operational efficiency, improve data protection and security continuously. One way to protect
                  the
                  vulnerabilities of web-based appointment and scheduling management information system devices is to
                  identify and mitigate the threats present in the system.</p>
                <p>Web-based appointment and scheduling management information platforms are posing a growing danger to
                  threat actors that are seeking to compromise and steal personal information for personal or for cyber
                  wars. The web-based appointment and scheduling management information platforms in all aspects of
                  their
                  operations, health care systems are under intense pressure to maintain a safe interface including
                  those
                  involving external staff, because any device like the internet of things are vulnerable to
                  cyber-attack.As
                  neglecting these prompt, signifies fines for any loss or abuse of data.
                  It is vital to double-check that the appointment management information system is secured on its
                  network
                  traffic to reduce the risk of being hacked and avoid web sniffing attacks. The lack of awareness of
                  the
                  service, low computer skills and incompatibility of the online appointment service is a RED flag and
                  should be avoided. Using the STRIDE modeling approach to trace and identify these threats. It is
                  crucial
                  to understand that vulnerabilities do not only exist in codes but also exist in the application's
                  structure and architecture and to mitigate cyber threat, Incident response plans should involve
                  post-incident strategies. </p>

       # Authentication, password management, or the usage of secure credentials such as API keys 
       # are required in almost every application. You may not be a security specialist, but you 
       # should know how to handle all of these passwords and credentials safely in order to protect 
       # your app's users' credentials and data, as well as your own API keys and tokens.

       # Generating, validating, storing securely, and protecting these security pieces from attackers 
       # are all part of keeping them safe. So, in this post, we'll look at Python libraries, tools, and 
       # concepts that can assist you in doing just that!

       # Python application with a command-line interface. 
       input() will allow password compromised so; instead we use  get pass

       password = getpass.getpass()
       # Do Stuff...

       #get pass commandline extracts users current user name and password
        It's sometimes better to generate a password rather than ask the user for one.
        For example, if you want to establish an initial password that is updated when you log 
        in for the first time.

       # There isn't a library for generating passwords, but it's not difficult to implement:
        import string
        import secrets

       #length = 15
       # Choose wide set of characters, but consider what your system can handle
       #alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
       #password = ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for i in range(length))

       #using this short-lived token as first-time logon and advise to choose a strong password: 
 

       from xkcdpass import xkcd_password as xp

       word_file = xp.locate_wordfile()
       words = xp.generate_wordlist(wordfile=word_file, min_length=5, max_length=10)

       # but by chance  someone gets hold of the passwords in database, they will have exceptionally
