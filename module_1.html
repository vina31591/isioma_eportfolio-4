            <br>


            <h4>MY INITIAL POST</h4> 
            <p> Cybersecurity is a global affair that requires international collaboration to safeguard cyberspace. The increase in Cyber threats is a significant risk to the global economy. </p><br>
              Without Cybersecurity, the defence against data breaches, malware, Phishing, and other cyber-crimes; makes cyberspace desirable targets for cybercriminals. For example, the 2018 WannaCry ransomware attack, estimated 40% of worldwide healthcare institutions, paid an estimated £92 million due to a combination of ransoms and activities.  </p><br>
             
            <p>Also, on 9 November 2021, The Spanish beer maker DAMM in Barcelona haltered production after a cyber-attack where the plant that produces a staggering 7 million hectolitres of beer a year was hacked. However, the famous Estrella Damm lager did not say if a ransom was required or paid to the cybercriminals.

              <p> Therefore, the importance of cyber systems security cannot be overstated. 
                </p>Consequently, it is of the essence to protect sensitive personal data, governmental and industry information systems. </p><br>
                <p>To preserve the global trust of cyberspace and the avoidance of excessive

                          breaches, the protection of digital identities is a swift necessity. Having a well-executed plan reviewed is the first step to keeping information safe.</p></b><br>

                  Dear Isioma,


                  Thank you for sharing, and I have always wondered why healthcare institutions were frequently the target of cyberattacks? In addition, apart from the monetary aspect of this, what other negative impacts do you see when these companies have been susceptible to cyberattacks?
                  
                  Thank you.<br>
                 <h6> <b>Reply to Bee Teck Ivan Chua</b></h6>
                 <p>Global Healthcare is becoming increasingly vulnerable to online cyber-attacks due to a lack of time and resources to educate staff about online risks. In addition, these hospitals have medical appliances made without security in mind, with an unimaginable amount of patient Confidential data. Even though medical apparatus may not store the patient data, it can pitch cyber-attacks on important information.

                  Cyber security training plays a vital role here to avoid reputational damage.
                  
                  Data protection and privacy laws are also a requirement meant to manage cybersecurity. If data is accidentally or deliberately compromised, fines and regulatory sanctions are deployed for appropriate measures.</p><br>

                   Hi Isioma

                   </p> I always find it interesting to hear people’s opinions on the WannaCry attack on the NHS. As this involved damage to patients and the care they were receiving it had a huge impact on the UK at the time. 
                   However, although this attack cost the NHS £92 million in recovery costs, they did not suffer the same from brand or reputational damage as a private organisation may have had because most people in the UK have no other choice than to use the NHS services.
                   Therefore, competitive advantage is a not an incentive for them to invest in their Cyber Security. Although it can be argued that due to the type of sensitive and medical data the NHS processes they should have stronger controls in place to protect their patients, 
                   investing more into the security of the business takes money away from medical services that need investing in as well. Do you think investment of security is as important as spending the money on more doctors, nurses, medical equipment etc?  </p><br>
             <p>

                Reply to Elizabeth Cook</h6></b></p>
                <p>Human resources and Technology are principal health system inputs. Various factors emerge that affect investment in health care and the acquisition of security of cyberspace. 
                However, Healthcare organizations are not standing by idly; many have taken active steps to protect themselves.  The WannaCry cyber-attacks on the NHS have demonstrated the importance of a robust and evidence-based framework to combat cybercrime in the healthcare system and society in general.

                <p> However, the (NHS) Department was warned about the risks of a cyberattack a year before.  The cyber incident disrupted the health care service. It could have caused more disruption if it had not been stopped by cyber security researchers that activated the  ‘kill switch’ so that WannaCry stopped locking devices.
                
                Technology inspires healthcare more than any other influential cause, and in the future, it will continue to develop in dramatic ways.
                
                 Thus, the investment in cybersecurity is as significant as investing in healthcare, improving safety events, reporting, information sharing, end-user education training, and response to cybersecurity events must involve all parties to avoid future attacks. </p><br>

              </p> Hi Elizabeth,

              Thank you for sharing your thoughts on NHS and how the people in the UK have no other choice and there is no incentive for them to invest in Cyber security. I have a slightly different opinion from yours and the reason is the people are not going to be happy due to the disruption (even though no data were compromised due to the nature of the attack) and this may affect the political chances of the current government to win the next election. In addition, the image of NHS is also a reflection of the reputation of the government.
              
              Thanks.<p><br>

                Hi Isioma.

                 <p>To add a little to the importance of cyber security in the health sector.

                  As a result of the Covid 19 pandemic, the cyberattack has increased dramatically, affecting the health care sector, as the world health organisation alerted. The number of cyberattacks is now more than five times what it used to be before the pandemic endangering the health care industry revealing a considerable risk for health processes. However, this risk comes from people actions, technology failure that results from cyber-attacks.<p><br>
                    </p>Some healthcare providers use IoT applications to provide critical medical services such as embedded context prediction, embedded gateway configuration; indirect emergency treatment; semantic medical access; wearable device access; health information regarding children, community healthcare, and adverse drug reactions. Beneficiaries can receive these services using various medical IoT applications, such as healthcare solutions that use smartphones, wheelchair and medication management, rehabilitation systems, and systems to monitor oxygen saturation, body temperature, blood pressure and electrocardiograms; and sensing blood glucose level. These IoT applications can reduce medical services’ costs, improve the users’ experiences and serve more patients with the limited availability of healthcare resources. (WIRED Staff, 2011) However, the attack on this IOT product will hamper and significantly affect primary health care services delivery. Therefore, the importance of cybersecurity can never be overemphasised as much and greater need for the proper security of these IoT appliances.<p><br>

                            <p> The issues and challenges around cybersecurity have increased to the context of global affairs at an unprecedented level, both online and offline; Cybersecurity is now in the public’s consciousness because this threat does not recognise international borders. As pointed out in Okafor-Tolofari, I.V (2021) initial post, the WannaCry ransomware attack has brought much attention to the importance of cybersecurity in the health care sector. Muthuppalaniappan, M. and Stevenson, K. (2020)</p><br>

                            <p>Cook, E. & kealramani, K. (2021) shared more light on how the WannaCry attack affected the UK NHS and whether the investment in cyber security should be as significant as medical personnel. Cabrera, E. (2018) also emphasised that every participation, development, and cooperation function is vital to cybersecurity. 
                           
                           The healthcare industry is now a popular target for hackers, where data is vulnerable due to massive volumes of personal data, insecure security systems, and a vast network of connected medical devices. Tolofari, S. (2021) highlighted the importance of cyber security in the health sector on the peer responses to the dramatic increase in the sophistication of cyber-crime due to the Covid 19 pandemic.</p><br>
                           
                           <p>The protection of cyberinfrastructure from hostile actors is complex and never-ending. Although, despite these constraints, cybersecurity in different organisations, be it health, business, or IT (information technology), is exceptional for safety for society because Risk assessment depends on the identification of the threat actor.
                           
                           Chua, B.T.I. and Tebogo, V. (2021) brought insightful thoughts about cybersecurity, and its cyber-crimes negative impact on companies and the importance to empower law enforcement agencies” in the pursuit of perpetrators.</p><br>
                           
                           <p>Nevertheless, governments enact laws, like the EU law on cybercrimes, which adopted a standard policy to protect its society against cybercrime through proper legislation and fostering international cooperation.
                           
                           In conclusion, The Engagement of different practitioners with cyber security has a great chance to reduce the risk and the impact of a range of cyber-attacks. Therefore, there is an enormous need to bring large-scale security improvement, training, and maintenance approaches to the cyber domain.</br>

                    <p>The data loss prevention system and Anti-malware software are technological solutions that enable any IT infrastructure to conduct critical processes once installed. 
                      It detects and stops malicious and unwanted executable files while reducing the risk of exposing sensitive information from leaving or entering the corporate network and from users uploading information or data from the web, sending sensitive data out by e-mail, or transferring sensitive data to removable devices</p></br>
                      <p>Taking a step into a security operations centre where Data Loss Prevention and anti-malware solutions analyse, investigate, escalate events and provide consistent remediation. 
                        The need for Data Loss Prevention is to reduce the risk of accidental data breaches and the range of security issues that exist through all the layers of an IT infrastructure. The security objective is to preserve an organisation network's privacy, accessibility, and accountability. </p></br>
                        <p>66.2% of business users have sent e-mails erroneously; most incidents of this sort are human-caused errors or carelessness, making countermeasures challenging to contain. (Tomoyoshi et al., 2010),</p></br>

                        <p>Similarly, the causes of information and data loss have become progressively assorted; prevalent mediums such as social networking sites and instant messenger gives channels for information misuse. At the same time, the expanded drive towards flexible working has caused a noteworthy development in versatile gadgets being able to put away vast volumes of information from the network. </p></br>
                          <p>Moreover, the Anti-malware software creates protection for information technology systems from malicious software and content analysis in real-time. Thereby detecting and blocking sensitive data and malware while in use (endpoint action), in-motion (network traffic) and at rest (data storage). (Securosis, L.L.C., 2010)

                            Data loss prevention and Anti-malware solutions protect data and provide software security, which requires systematic effort with the rise of modern information security systems. Organisations ought to survey new solutions and supplant bequest systems. (Capone, 2019) However, to effectively manage data loss prevention and Anti-malware, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines and other standard organisations provide the controls needed.</p></br>

                <b>Abstract</b></h6>

                <p>Secure appointment scheduling information management system is increasingly becoming a must-have technology for service-based Organisations. Integrating these cutting-edge technologies into an existing complicated Information technology infrastructure poses additional security issues for data protection and cybersecurity.  Booking an appointment online has grown over the years as a web-based online appointment management system makes appointments accessible. The appointment scheduling system tracks appointments, reschedule appointments based on constraints, resolves conflicts, and manages all interactions. It allows patients to check and communicate with their doctors at their convenience.
                  An online appointment management system allows patients to register and book their appointments with their doctors, and the system best determines which specialist is available in each case. This system helps lessen the burden of waiting for information at the help desk or the clinical staff. In addition, the appointment scheduling software cancels visiting hours appointments in case any changes occur through e-mails. Logging in and registering is displayed on the home page, patients (users)must login to access their  account, using either their names, e-mail address and  password.
                 </p><br>

                 <h6><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h6>

                 <p>Most aspects of online appointment management, such as reservations, cancellations and confirmations, are controlled automatically. The web-based appointment and scheduling management information system is intended to satisfy the growing population. This software can be accessed 24/7, providing an efficient way of related clinical tasks and avoiding the queue in enhancing doctor timetable management. Since patient satisfaction is of utmost importance, notifications and reminders are sent to all patients through letters or e-mails to prevent false appointments scheduling. 
                  The Network and Information Security Directive (N.I.S.D.) 2016/1148/E.U. and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations among others compels all organisations working with citizens personal data to manage and process that data under strict guidelines must be taken into account. The General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) governs every data an organisation collects across credible platforms of identifiable living individuals. The GDPR is a complicated policy, and there are consequences if any organisation are found wanting on these policies. (Argaw et al., 2020).</p>
                  
                 <p>Lately, there have been countless diverse tendencies in cybercrime on web-based appointment and scheduling management information systems. The frequency of data breaches is alarming. Therefore threat modeling is a crucial aspect of the web based appointment scheduling information management, aiming at software and hardware security in reducing potential threats through identifying and prioritising threat. Web-based appointment and scheduling management software should be implemented using </p>
                 <p>threat modeling system like STIRDE. It gives the security team an edge in tracking and combating unintentional or malicious activities.
                  Queens Medical Centre general objectives are concerned about the current high rate of cybercrime and the government’s policy on patient data protection. There is a lot to acknowledge regarding web-based appointment and scheduling management information systems, which should be designed applying only trusted software. Medical records based on patient history, personal health information containing individuals’ medical files and digital radiography electronic data, these pieces of information are delivered through an internal and external network that serves as a medium of communication that includes confidential data such as name, date of birth, health and genetic information, insurance and health.
                  Despite these constraints, the system needs to keep patients, Doctors, appointments. Using a web-based application, users or patient’s login to Queens medical centre, the appointment Scheduling System records all the I.P. addresses of the login section. These Login sessions and all information are stored in the database. Therefore, making it easy to track the user’s details from the web in case of a cyber incident. 
                  The concern on patient information confidentiality may arise due to general security issues. Cybersecurity professionals at Queens Medical Centre must consider that most medical devices introduce numerous vulnerabilities in a hospital’s system security.
                  The most prevalent point of compromise is e-mail. Common instances are phishing attacks that aim to collect patients’ credentials and clinical personnel’s login passwords through e-mail or harvesting. Numberless attackers research websites for e-mail addresses and other contact information through active reconnaissance. They feed their spam machines in the hopes of finding easy targets. The Security Development Lifecycle includes threat modeling as an essential component. 
                  The STRIDE threat model provides an evocative procedure for security threats developed by Praerit Garg and Loren Kohn Felder at Microsoft are expatiated into the following steps.</p>
                  
                 <p>•	Spoofing</p>
                 <p>•	Tampering</p>
                 <p>•	Repudiation</p>
                 <p>•	Information disclosure (privacy breach or data leak)</p>
                 <p>•	Denial of service</p>
                 <p>•	Elevation of privilege</p>
                 
                 <h6><b>Technological analysis </b></h6>

                 <p>The objective viewpoint of this threat model is to secure potential security vulnerabilities and needs to be constantly reviewed. Cybercriminals can gain access into any system through various means, Remote access portals, the network, Users, Mobile devices, E-mail, and Web applications. As earlier mentioned, Phishing attack; is an attack vector that threatens data safety. It is a technique that a malicious attacker uses to steal user’s credentials.
                  Therefore, it is imperative to install a secure web-based appointment and scheduling management information system. The following characteristics should be considered essential while employing the STRIDE Threat Model to the web-based appointment and scheduling information management system for Queens medical.</p>
                  
                  <p>•	Patient-focused computing that is easy to use and maintain.</p> 
                  <p>•	Provide integrated cross-platform support and browser compatibility</p> 
                  <p>•	Staff awareness and training</p> 
                  <p>•	Input validation testing application for compliance to standard</p> 
                  <p>•	Developed mechanisms and structures to handle complaints and procedures.</p> 
                  <p>•	The E-mail link should have a redirect application for password reset in case of compromise.</p> 
                  <p>•	Rapid response to cyber threats</p> 
                  <p>STRIDE Threat Model Examine each component’s vulnerability to threats and has the following characteristics and breaches of basic security standards. </p>

                  <h6><b>SPOOFING </b></h6>
                  <p>Spoofing refers to the act of posing as someone else, where an attacker can forge its identity to masquerade as another by creating an illegitimate identity like falsifying or modifying its MAC address to another device. E-mail spoofing is used to lure patients into disclosing personal information or harvesting patients’ credentials. Through tactics like de-authentication attack, where the attacker forges its sender address, a technique commonly used to hide the origin of their e-mails and manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems. </p>

                  <h6><b>MITIGATIONS </b></h6>

                  <p>•	Multi-factor authentication: Using a strong password policy.</p>
                  <p>Patients must be authenticated by the software.</p>
                  <p>•	Utilise anti-spoofing and e-mail verification components to channel messages based on legitimacy checks of the sender space and integrity of messages.</p>

                  <p>•	Active monitoring of social media activities related to your organisation.</p>
                  <p>•	Segment operational assets to ensure strict isolation of critical control information within the control environment.</p>
                  <p>•	User Training: staffs should be trained to identify social engineering techniques attempts.</p>
                  <p>•	Making e-mail secure, the secure socket layer (SSL) is a safe way of sending encrypted information, which is more secured than a conversational paper-based referral that an attacker can intercept.</p>

                  <h6><b>TAMPERING  </b></h6>
                  <p>Is a security threat that refers to the unauthorised modification of data to gain control over a system or database. Tampering could either be: 
                    <p>(1) Physical Tampering and</p>
                     <p>(2) Network Tempering,</p> 
                    Both Physical and network tempering deal with intentionally modifying data.
                    The threat actor intends to alter data in transit, data at rest or data in use; an unauthorised intruder could gather information, intercept a data packet, and change its destination data in transit, with data at rest its modifying data.</p>
                    
                    <h6><b>MITIGATIONS  </b></h6>
                     <p>Monitor and evaluate electronic transactions to support the integrity of the network and application </p>

                     <p>•	Security operations: Monitor the performance of various system security functions to ensure proper procedures.</p>
                     <p>•	Minimum privileges must be assigned to users. With the least privileges and division of duties protocols, appropriate access control techniques such as role-based access control (RBAC) must be installed. (“Threat Modeling for Mobile Health Systems - HHS.gov”)</p>
                     <p>•	Secure protocols for communications must be put in place to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of all communication at Queens Medical Centre.</p>
                     <p>•	Domain administrator accounts should not be utilized for daily operations, it may expose the account to unprivileged systems.</p>
                     <p>The below diagram illustrates how a tampering attack works all the way into disrupting the production process of an automated production system.</p>
                    
                     <h6><b>REPUDIATION:  </b></h6>
                     <p>Is the denial of a particular action related to e-transactions. For example, electronic communications, information that contains users' personal data and staff data. Authorised users can perform illegal operations, and the system cannot trace this information back to them. Information must be treated with confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation.</p>



                     h6><b>MITIGATION </b></h6>
                     <p>•	Accountability and non-repudiation systems to track and link actions.</p>
                     <p>•	Secure audit of all sensitive data must be logged and recorded.</p>
                     <p>•	A digital signature should be used for entity identification, authentication and integrity of a message, to avoid attackers communicating remotely with the selected target.</p>

                     <p>•	Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.</p>

                     <h6><b>INFORMATION DISCLOSURE </b></h6>

                     <p>Is a data breach or information leakage; this allows malicious attackers to gather valuable information and reveal sensitive information of a patient’s medical history after obtaining valuable knowledge through active reconnaissance (attack.mitre.org, n.d.). Technological innovation presents a unique security challenge where Mobile devices are difficult to control in any organisation network because most are utilised for personal communications and can be linked to vulnerabilities like unpatched software installed on the mobile device or theft of the device that might land on the hands of adversaries creating a point for credential harvest.</p>


                     <h6><b>MITIGATION </b></h6>
                     <p>Ascertain that proper access control mechanisms are in place and that only authorised users have access to these data.</p>
                     <p>•	Ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted</p>
                     <p>•	Ascertain that message confidentiality standards protect all communication channels.</p>
                     <p>•	Ascertain that proper access control mechanisms are in place and that only authorised users have access to data.</p>

                     <h6><b>DENIAL OF SERVICE </b></h6>

                     <p>Is a type of cyber-attack that aims to bring a system or network to a halt, rendering network resources unusable or inaccessible to their intended users. Here attackers intend to Disrupt the proper functioning or the availability of the appointment system by targeting the infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic and distract the incident response team. Attackers identify the vulnerability in the network through multiple compromised systems and which systems can be exploited  and controlled remotely to exploit the clinical security system.</p>
                     <h6><b>MITIGATION </b></h6>
                     <p>•	Ensure step-by-step instructions on reacting to a DDoS attack and ensure Endpoint security that provides network endpoints.</p>
                    
                     <p>•	Web security tools should be installed to remove web-based threats, block abnormal traffic, and search for known attack signatures.</p>
                     <p>•	Network segmentation should be implemented to protect the network from DDOS attacks (separates systems into subnets)</p>
                     <p>•	Continuous Monitoring of Network Traffic</p>

                     <h6><b>ELEVATION OF PRIVILEGES  </b></h6>
                           <p>Elevation of privilege attacks allegedly uses security flaws to gain access to a network and applications. The attacker tries to gain access to a lower account like a user through phishing attack and uses the compromised account to gain a higher-level privilege.
                            This could be described as the most threatening of the STRIDE framework as users, being the weakest link in the security chain. This can be possible over a regular user’s account on the network and then attempts to gain administrative permissions. To ultimately steal users’ information from the data base of the ASMIS.</p>

                     <h6><b>MITIGATION </b></h6>
                     <p>•	Applications with known vulnerabilities should not have set user identity on execution or the "set user identity. bits" set to reduce the potential damage if they are compromised. </p>
                     <p>Users should be removed from the local administrator group on systems and the most pressing data protection issues should be addressed.</p>
                     <p>•	Monitor the file system for files that have malicious signatures.</p>
                     <p>•	Files should be encrypted such that passwords are always required. (attack.mitre.org, n.d.)</p>
                     <p>•	“Develop a robust cyber threat intelligence capability to determine what types and levels of threat may use software exploits and 0-days against a particular organization”. (attack.mitre.org, n.d.)</p>
                           
                     <h6><b>CONCLUSION  </b></h6>
                     <p>Adopting innovative technology to improve solutions offers operational excellence opportunities to increase operational efficiency, improve data protection and security continuously. One way to protect the vulnerabilities of web-based appointment and scheduling management information system devices is to identify and mitigate the threats present in the system.</p>
                     <p>Web-based appointment and scheduling management information platforms are posing a growing danger to threat actors that are seeking to compromise and steal personal information for personal or for cyber wars. The web-based appointment and scheduling management information platforms in all aspects of their operations, health care systems are under intense pressure to maintain a safe interface including those involving external staff, because any device like the internet of things are vulnerable to cyber-attack.As neglecting these prompt, signifies fines for any loss or abuse of data.
                      It is vital to double-check that the appointment management information system is secured on its network traffic to reduce the risk of being hacked and avoid web sniffing attacks. The lack of awareness of the service, low computer skills and incompatibility of the online appointment service is a RED flag and should be avoided. Using the STRIDE modeling approach to trace and identify these threats. It is crucial to understand that vulnerabilities do not only exist in codes but also exist in the application's structure and architecture and to mitigate cyber threat, Incident response plans should involve post-incident strategies. </p>
