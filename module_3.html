          <h1>Information Risk Management</h1>
          <br>
          <p>This module is designed to explain the increase dependency on proactive defense of Cyber Security and
            deeper understanding of modern information and system protection technology and methods  (Information Risk Management).
            <p> A Security Risk Management (RM) strategy is essential because it enables companies to identify and implement security requirements in an economical manner. Because security 
              threats are so numerous, it is impossible to address all of them since <li> All technological security solutions cost money.</li> 
            <li> Companies have limited resources</li> It is 
              imperative that companies adopt only those solutions that will result in a significant Return on Investment (ROI). Analyzing costs and risks involves comparing the costs of a 
              solution with the risks associated with it.
              A successful cyberattack could cause business disruptions, including the cost of not using it.
              A security risk management program ensures that a company's goals are aligned between its business and technology (IT) strategies.</p>

            <h4><b>Information Risk Management: Definitions, Standards and Approaches</b></h4>
            <p> Risk is an interdisciplinary and multifaceted concept and, therefore, its definition cannot be defined explicitly. Risk is present in every aspect of a person's life, especially
               in economics and management. In other words, there are different types of risks and different types of risk management. For instance, risk is a measurable variable.</p>
            <ul>
              <p> Information resource management involves identifying weaknesses and threats to information resources an organization uses in order to achieve business objectives and deciding 
                which countermeasures to take in order to reduce risk to acceptable levels, thereby increasing the probability of success and reducing the likelihood of failure.</p>
              <p> 
                In order to achieve a high level of risk management, IT systems that store, process, or transmit information should be more secure. In addition, management should be able to make
                 informed decisions about risk man-management. This will enable them to justify expenditures made as part of an IT budget, as well as assist management in defining the objectives
                  of risk management. By virtue of the documentation produced by the risk management process, authorizing (or approving) the IT systems.</p>

              <h4>COLLABORATIVE LEARNING DISCUSSION 1</h4>
              <h4>Topic:</h4> Read the Spears & Barki (2010) article (Unit 2 reading list) then discuss the following:

              <li>How did the authors use both Qualitative and Quantitative assessment approaches? What benefits did each approach yield?</li>
              What do the authors list as the advantages of involving users in the risk management process?</li>
              Based on the findings of the research,
            <li> how will the lack of user access affect the risk assessment you will carry out as part of your assessment?</li>
                <li> will it affect the choice of Qualitative vs. Quantitative assessment methods you utilise?</li>
                <li>how might you mitigate any issues encountered?</li>
          
                  <p></p>

              

              <h4>MY INITIAL POST</h4>
              <p> According to Spears & Barki's (2010) article, qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to analyse user participation in SRM. This article aims to examine user 
                participation in information security risk management in the context of regulatory compliance via a multi-method study at the organisational level. The authors tested the 
                theoretical model they had developed during the Qualitative research phase using Quantitative methods. In this way, the quantitative and qualitative methods combined produce a 
                vital context and allow the study to be broadly tested (Spears and Barki, 2010). </p><br>

              <p>User participation raises organisational awareness of security risks and controls within business processes. The need for regulatory compliance may encourage user participation 
                in SRM within targeted business processes. Security managers can harness the opportunity to engage users as an opportunity to better align security measures with business 
                objectives. As a result of SRM, users' awareness of security risks and controls in business processes improved, resulting in perceived improvements in control development and 
                performance. SRM awareness within a business process influences security controls' perceived performance positively(Spears and Barki, 2010). </p><br>
              <p>To preserve the global trust of cyberspace and the avoidance of excessive

                The article points out that user engagement is crucial to IS security, as it provides the expertise needed to strengthen security measures. Participation from users is another 
                way to get them involved in corporate operations and is crucial to secure sensitive data. Thereby engaging users to  contribute and improved security control performance through
                 increased awareness and a better alignment between IS security risk management and the business environment(Spears and Barki, 2010)</p></b><br>

              <h6>Peer Response by  Osarodion Samuel Tolofari</h6>
              Great review Isioma, to add to add to your detailed points,

                       The importance of qualitative and quantitative information risk approaches should never be understated because they are a long-term cycle. All steps must be taken; risk 
                       identification alone will not save a company from going out of business. A qualitative research design has a flexible structure because it can be constructed and 
                       reconstructed to a greater extent. Thus, using qualitative methods can result in a thorough and appropriate analysis of an issue. For example, rather than discovering and 
                       interpreting the meanings that people bring to their actions, research focuses on aspects of social behaviour that can be qualified and patterned (Rahman, 2017).

                      Risk identification should be done with greater care, and all risks must be identified and treated carefully. It is critical to evaluate and assess potential threats, 
                      vulnerabilities, and potential damage. This assessment should be followed by the implementation of necessary controls for cost-effectiveness and risk reduction. A cost 
                      analysis is required to determine which controls are most appropriate. Its results can assist managers in implementing the controls that produce the greatest benefit for 
                      the organisation (Rahman, 2017).

                          The management of risks helps managers improve the business process and to better control business practices. Good risk analysis and the right measures will not only
                           prevent the organisation from disappearing from the market but also make it easier to achieve the desired results. </p><br>
